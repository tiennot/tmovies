10	Kingsman:The Secret Service,is the latest and best comic book adaptation of the writer Mark Millar by the director of Kick-ass and X-men:First Class,Matthew Vaughn,it combines the best elements of his style and humor and the tropes of famous spy-thrillers ,to make a wildly entartaining piece of modern cinema,one that acts as a parody of the modern Bond flicks,while respecting everything that made the 60s,70s Bond movies so much fun. The casting in the film is absolutely brilliant, from Colin Firth's terrific portrayal of Harry Hart, a British veteran spy,with gentlemanny manners that make us men,to Taron Egerton's portrayal of Gary Unwin,as a promising street kid ,with an abusive stepfather that constantly puts both him and his mother under harsh conditions.The chemistry between Harry and Gary,is excellent ,with them both learning a few things from each-other and becoming more steeped into each-others lives,it is great to watch these two on-screen and their relationship has a reasonable start and moves with a lot of naturalism and great bonding material,that doesn't sound cheesy or boring ,it is just emotional and filled with a lot of heart and soul.The film's villain is absolutely great as well ,Samuel L. Jackson proves to us once again that he is a very likeable and by now legendary actor ,that we all love so much,and Richmond Valentine is a very different character from Nick Fury,Valentine hates the sight of blood,which leads to a few comic moments with his side-kick Gazelle played by Sofia Boutella ,who has prostetic-blade legs,that she uses in greatly choreographed action sequences.Mark Strong plays a convincing mentor,that recruits and trains the kingsmen agents,and the dialogue exchange between all of them is superbly written and acted.Michael Caine has a small but equally important role as Arthur,the head of the Kingsman,and his voice makes him sound like a convincing leader and like a man with a lot of respect and loyalty to his country and other fellow Kingsmen,which makes the twist surrounding him all the more unpredictable and shocking.The story and the characters make a lot of references to other movies as well,My Fair lady,Pretty Woman and so on,yet it's not just for the sake of it being funny,the point of the movie is that sometimes its the poeple that seem like a lost cause,that may end up surprising you and proving their worth,which makes those references smart and well-utilized.The tone stays consistent throughout,even in its extremely violent but spectacular action sequences.In conclusion,everything about the plot and the characters is eecuted perfectly and you stay engaged in the film from start to finish. Make no mistake though,action-wise,this is the best Vaughn has ever been,his style and use of blood,gore and gadgets is breathtaking to watch.The direction is the reason to that,Vaughn evolved as a filmmaker,the action is widely shot,with not a lot of cuts or editting,the film has absolutely zero use of shakey-cam,which both makes it cool to watch and appropriate to the veteran spies ,who have many years of martial arts training.Vaughn allows us to soak in the action and enjoy what we see,he is a risk-taking director that is not afraid to show the audiences what he envisioned,he understands the action world masterfully and is able to add some stylish choices along the way to make the extreme violence be as fun and light as possible.There is a church scene here ,where all the doors are locked and Harry is forced to fight of about a hundred of Hate group church members,the scene is a masterpiece of modern cinema,an astonishing 6 minute fight ,shot in one-take ,that elevates Vaughn over other filmmakers such as Guy Ritchie even and looks gorgeous,with the sequence set to the song of Freebird by Lynyrd Skynyrd,possibly the best and longest guitar solo you can get,which accompanies the action with such brilliance and adrenaline,that it almost seems like a never-ending ballet,which invloves fight choreography rivaling the Raid films.The action is equal to the story and characters,and both are awesome. In the end ,as a fan of both Mark Millar and Matthew Vaughn,I must say that Kingsman:The Secret service,represents all the things I love from these guys,all the things I love from spy-thrillers and all the things i love in a good movie,that's why this film is so fantastic and one of the very best.
0	I hated this movie. It's not just a truly horrible film, it's so incredibly ultraviolent it's like the video game Grand Theft Auto with zombies, only worse. This was the most disgusting violence, gratuitous and glorified, truly over the top. The trailer for this movie is 100 % misleading. It makes it look like a James Bond movie but in reality it's more like a zombie movie. Horrible, horrible, horrible. I wish I could un-buy this movie ticket. I wish I could un-see this movie. It's truly the worst movie I've ever seen. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!
8	This movie is just fun from start to finish. It is funny and has the spirit of the old James Bond movies. Samuel Jackson is just a great villain. And the head exploding scene was and is just awesome I have never seen it done like it was all you can do is watch unable to look away and try not to laugh.
8	Like Vaughn's last Mark-Millar-based film "Kick-Ass," "Kingsman: The Secret Service" acts as a potently raucous and gleefully subversive commentary on the subgenre it inhabits, without coming off as a straight parody. Also - it's freaking hilarious and a helluva lot of fun.
9	The acting talent in this movie is out of this world. Sam Jackson, Colin Firth, Mark Strong and of course Michael Caine all knock it out of the park. The action scenes are exciting and fun, and unlike many other action movies you can actually follow the fighting (instead of it turning into a big blur of people tumbling around/shooting) because it was filmed so cleverly. It's very funny, with excellent visuals and great action. This is absolutely worth seeing in theaters.
8	The movie is great! Although violent at some parts, it still was awesome! Colin Firth and Taron Egerton we're terrific. The movie appeals to me a lot, I definitely recommend it! Luke S, RelationzReviews
10	This was an awesome movie to see in the theater! I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. I don't get the critic's general poor reviews but I have learned to ignore them awhile ago, they are likely paid off. Always trust user reviews over the critics.
9	This film knows how to have fun. Being one of the big movies coming out early 2015, this movie had to impress, and yes.... it did. With creative writing and an interesting plot, though a little predictable at times, will make you wear a smile on your face. The only issue is that is can be very violent at times, a little too much for my taste. But if you liked Kick-Ass and films like it, you will love this film.
8	Less serious than James Bond, (mostly) more serious than Austin Powers. Fantastic as both of them, a refreshing and surprisingly good movie with likable characters.
2	Really dreadful. Kingsman shows some promise and Colin Firth does his best to prop up this movie. However, it all comes undone in the last 20 minutes. Some very crude humor about anal sex and the 3 minute exploding head sequence (feels much, much longer) were the low points. The trailer tries to make this film look cool and stylish, it is neither. The director can't seem to resist dumb special effects and one-note jokes. When you have Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Caine and Colin Firth, you should be able to do much better than this. Don't know if he was trying to be true to the graphic novel or just wanted to tick some marketing check boxes. Just a huge waste of time and money. If you are looking for something to entertaining to watch, look elsewhere.
8	Kingsmen: The Secret Service is an action packed thrill ride full of exciting fight scenes, some great characters, and a very smart script. It's funny, brutal, and just a great watch.
0	While the movie was entertaining, it deserves a 0, for it's overt anti christian propaganda. If they did to blacks or Jews what they do to christians in this movie, it would be protested and shunned. There is a key scene where the hero goes to what I can only presume is the writers interpretation of a "typical" christian church service. All in attendance are bigots, homophobes and "anti-government" types. But don't worry because the hero goes nuts and slaughters all of them during the service due to the mind control rays of the evil genius. I heard viewers in the audience guffawing in approval at the death of those "horrible christian bigots". Mission accomplished hollywood. Defame all that is good and glorify evil. At the end of the movie we get to enjoy some anal sex too. Nice job..... NOT.
6	Kingsman: The Secret Service was definitely a fun movie, with elaborately cartoonish violence and fun stunts. Samuel L. Jackson was absolutely amazing as the villain, and his rapport with Colin Firth was wonderful--their shared acknowledgement of spy movie tropes made for some great meta moments. However, I found the plot wasn't quite compelling enough to keep me engaged for the long-ish runtime, especially since the ending is a bit drawn out. It straddled the line of satire and sincerity in an interesting way, mocking and embracing the genre's tropes simultaneously. It was a solid movie with a lot of amazing sequences, but for me it just didn't quite come together. However, I should freely admit that spy movies are not my favourite genre, so there were probably references I missed out on. Still, an enjoyable romp-y kind of movie with fun action and dialogue.
10	Have to give it a 10 to counterbalance this **** "While the movie was entertaining, it deserves a 0, for it's overt anti christian propaganda. If they did to blacks or Jews what they do to christians in this movie, it would be protested and shunned. "
7	Not bad overall. Unexpectedly lighthearted nature of the characters for the level of violence. Violence was over-the-top, fast-paced, almost cartoon style with everything sped up. I give it a 7 because the story was alright and the movie was fun to watch. Probably recommend a rent if you haven't seen it.
7	It's a nice action-spy comedy movie, my friends and I did enjoy it, and so did the majority of the theater as I was listening to their comments while leaving. I did find the story a bit stupid and sometimes way too stupid, but, hey, it's good entertainment, and i wasn't expected to be enlightened or spiritually uplifted. Fight scenes are nice, but church scene and gun fight scene at the end were way too long and noisy. Above average movie overall compared to last year and beginning of 2015.
1	This movie starts out OK , however turns into a murder spree where you just wanna leave the theatre. The good guys turn into the bad guys and its all downhill from there , virtually no entertainment value whatsoever. Worst movie Ive seen in a long long time.
5	A juvenile version of James Bond. Could have been so much better if they had a sense of how far is too far. Oh well. I really was enjoying it at first but then they had to go for R rateing.
10	This movie is simply amazing, truly original, and I can't think of anything else to say, I guess this isn't the typical commentary you usually see ;) 10/10
8	I had an absolute blast. Kingsman is witty, fun, explosive, loud, and unapologetic. It definitely takes things too far in the best of ways. It feels cheap, but it plays to that weakness and makes it an advantage. I'm looking forward to the sequel.
7	When I saw the trailers for this movie, I didn't think much of it. Then I went to see it on a whim with some friends. I enjoyed it all the way through. I acknowledge that it has a few problems. But without nitpicking, and without worrying about the ending (No, I am not going to say what it is!) it's a pretty good movie. I wouldn't call it the best super spy movie of all time. But it's worth a watch.
8	This was Kill Bill meets James Bond on steroids! I was shocked and impressed by Colin Firth action sequences because he's mainly in Oscar worthy type productions. It want be a hyped film except with cult audiences, due to the UK producing eccentric over the top action comedy, but still with class and Hollywood flavor. They always have Bond!
10	Kingsman turned out to be one of the best well directed movie I've seen so far of this genre. Polishing the old way of British spy movies with li'l bit of comedy and mostly the surprising action with a fresh view. I went to the theater right away at the first show and I have to admit it worth it. Probably might become one of the classic iconic movie of all time of this genre.
10	Kingsman is the perfect blend of action and comedy. The film has a very engaging plot with plenty of action scenes to keep any viewer entertained. There are also a lot of great laugh out loud moments and one-liners in this movie. I did not go into the movie with high expectations, but I left very satisfied. Kingsman is an absolute must watch!
0	I went to this movie with low expectations but it didn't even live up to them. I didn't mind that it was very violent but I did mind that the opening sequences were so ridiculous and predictable. I can't speak for the latter sequences, because I walked out after twenty minutes to try to find something more entertaining.
7	It's level of violence is ridiculous, but that's part of the charm of this fun, quirky spy movie. It's got some witty dialogue, some cool fight scenes, and some good acting performances, particularly by Colin Firth. It's a fun one for sure.
9	This is a epic spy film, the same way Scream was a slasher film. Kingsman does for spy films, what Scream did for horror films. The characters knowingly play out tropes and cliches of the spy genre, and play with them... Alot. A pastiche at its finest, it knows the story it's telling and doesn't want to hold back all its punches. Kingman perfectly transmits how gruesome something is, when people are saying "It's too violent, too horrific. I don't want to watch." When it conveys that something is gruesome and terrible, its mission has succeeded.
10	We had good time and the actors made this Movie jump off the screen. Special effects were sharp and effective. The Kingsman made for great night out, Worth price and popcorn plus the Box of Dots. Will buy the Blu-Ray
6	Pretty good cast. Lots of forced humor, though there are some truly funny bits here and there. Action is meh... I was not a fan of the fast-forwarding action parts, but the slow-mo action was nice and some of the fight choreography was sweet. For the most part the fights were a let down though. There's significant gore/dismemberment. Theres a sprinkling of parkour in here as well. Had difficulty a handful of times understanding what the bloody hell the actors were saying, but it was for the most part understandable. Some of the dry British humor and jokes went over my head (and most of the audiences, judging from the amount of laughter at some parts and complete lack of them in others where it was apparently supposed to be a funny scene). Overall, not terrible but not great.
4	If the director could have shown a little restraint and let the sublime humor carry the movie, this mess would have been a whole lot more memorable. Unfortunately, he succumbed to the lowest common denominator of viewers. For instance, he missed a great opportunity with all his big over-the-top mob fight scenes...how come we didn't go back to the pub and see the homeboys having a pint -- then pow -- the fight urge comes on out of nowhere. Instead of that stupid baby in the bathroom scene to manipulate emotions. The gratuitous anal ran counter to movie's whole philosophy of how a gentleman conducts himself. The film could have teased that ending (haha) without going for the cheap shot -- besides all those people should have been released from their cells. That's what heroes do, not that lame-ass royal ending. Many scenes dragged on and the score sucked...the typical overuse of music to make you think something is happening when it's just a guy sitting in a plane and some other guys walking towards him. This film could have stayed to its potentially sophisticated edge but decided to take the low road.
9	Best Spy Action Film In 2015 so far. Credit to Samuel Jackson for becoming a very fasinating villain. Hope they can do a sequal for this flims. Fun to watch. Worth every penny.
10	Kingsman is the most lavishly violent, sleek and funny spy movie that I have ever seen. Colin Firth is brilliant and newcomer Taron Edgerton was great in the supporting as well. Samuel Jackson made the perfect villain. One of my favorite directors- Matthew Vaughn, is at the top of his game.
10	Kingsman was a damn fun romp of a movie with what one might call less then politically correct humor, it is popcorn movie for sure but it is a popcorn movie that you will want to watch over and over again. It has the R rating for a reason and it uses that rating to its full extent with enthralling action scenes that give me flashbacks to Matrix reloaded (in a good way). The acting was pretty good, Colin was awesome as the very slick super agent Harry Heart that acts as a sudo father figure for our main character Garry"Eggsy"Unwin who was portrayed by Taron Egerton, Tarons acting was pretty good and only gets better as the character evolves into the James Bond style character that all the commercials tries to sell you. The movie will keep you engaged as the fairly vanilla but still silly plot unfolds. I mentioned that the movie has quite a bit of less then politically correct humor, if you are really sensitive to that kind of humor then i suggest that you spare your money and don't go and watch this because you probably don`t like fun and you will probably not like this. *rant ensuing* Now that the review is over i want to rant a little if you don't mind. When you went to see this movie you probably knew that this film was R rated..... why do you then go and cry about it being ultra violent on metacritic, any movie lover worth his/hers salt would at least check who made the movie and then decide if they wanted to see a move like this which clearly had the fingermarks of Matthew on it . *rant over*
10	I just loved it. Fast-paced, funny and extremely entertaining. Can't help but reading some of the critics's negative reviews and being: "Like, what the f`? on which planet do they live on?"
10	okay i freaking loved this movie so much, i don't know why theres as much bad reviews as there is because it was so awesome okay. like literally, the action sequences were so well executed without shaky-cam, and for Taron and Sophie being an actors that are just starting out, I think they did amazing. OKAY IT WAS AN AMAZING FREAKING MOVIE 10/10, WOULD RECOMMEND.
10	Matthew Vaughn is one of the best film makers I've ever seen. This movie is all that kick ass was and more. The soundtrack was great, the grotesque fighting was like something straight out of a comic book, and the comedy was hilarious. Matthew does fighting in a way that doesn't make it gross or distasteful. I believe that every one should see this movie right away and decided for yourself.
10	Upon first glance, Kingsman: The Secret Service looks like an outdated, outlandish attempt to reinvigorate the action spy genre that saw Pierce Brosnan fail miserable as his final appearance as the famous spy-agent James Bond in The World is Not Enough. Since 2005, thanks to the likes of Martin Campbell and Christopher Nolan, two directors that took two very different iconic action figures, Batman and James Bond, and injected a much needed, gritty, dark, reality-based foundation to these characters and their overall narratives, over-the-top action has long been expired. In the last decade, what has arisen, is a very dark and realistically twisted take on many action icons, both in the superhero genre and the action hero genre, that allows the cartoonish elements of these characters to fade, and the realistic to rise in popular and rewarding box office results. One of these aforementioned films that inhabited a reality based narrative structure was the recently re-invisioned X-Men film franchise, which was, ironically, reinvented by Matthew Vaughn in X-Men: First Class in 2011. The film, which took place in 1962, set around the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, showed just how much the comic book genre succeeded among audiences when introduced around real-world events. The amazing thing about Kingsman: The Secret Service, is that the same man who was responsible for breathing new, raw life into the X-Men franchise, after the disaster that Brett Ratnetâ€™s X-Men: The Last Stand was, is the same man that is bringing back the absolutely manic and outrageous spy-agent genre with a vengeance. Thankfully for everyone, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the action movie we have been waiting to see and the is the tremendously alternative to a highly unbelievable 007 movie that never came. Upon first view, I too was skeptical about the dynamics of Vaughnâ€™s newest Millar adaptation (Vaughn had already adapted Millarâ€™s Kick-Ass). Looking back at the trailers, the action looked silly; the players too cliched in the world of agent-spy standards; and gimmicky thanks to the inclusion of adorable pugs and attractive cast members. Boy was I wrong! Kingsman is a highly calculated film romp that never takes itself too seriously, yet never lets go of its grip of highly entertaining action movie and escapism Hollywood fluff. To think that Vaughn could have potentially abandoned this project completely to make X-Men: Days of Future Past is sad. Thankfully, the highly visionary and confident filmmaker stuck to his guns, and delivers easily, one of the most entertaining films of 2015 thus far. Kingsman begins as any action movie should; with a girl. But this girl, is a recently widowed mother who surprisingly has a stranger visit her in the late night, to tell her that her husband, a Kingsman (unbestknown to her) was killed in the line of duty. The stranger, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), is unwelcome in the home, and focuses his energy to his partners newborn son, Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton), where he discloses to him that, if ever in the future he encounters any problems, the Kingsman are indebted to them forever thanks to the bravery of their patriarch. Flash forward a decade, and Eggsy is a troublesome youth, whose failed attempts in the marines, and trouble with the law finds his luck at the **** end, time and time again. It isnâ€™t until Eggsy, who in an act of defiance for his mother against her petty mafia boyfriend, finds himself in a police station, in deperate need of the Kingsmans help. After a quick phone call, that ends ambiguously, Eggsy is released of the police station and greeted by the same man who visited him and his mother upon the news of his fatherâ€™s death, Harry Hart. Luckily for Eggsy, Harry offers him a job interview, that could see him in the same line of work as his father, and could change his world forever thanks to an unexpected visit to a tailor shoppe. On the surface, Kingsman seems to be a neat and well dressed action film. Once cracked open, Kingsman is a rough, tough, cocky-filled fuel ride of adrenaline, bad manners and tailored attitude that puts James Bond and company to shame.
9	Kingsman is an excellent film. One of the best espionage films I have seen. It, being a little of a parody of James Bond, has a really good story, beautiful shots, really unexpected twists, and it will make you laugh from the beginning to the end, also having really nice action scenes, really well directed and with a camera work really masterful. But really, the action scenes were really awesome, perfectly choreographed, and I just love the fact that here really is presented a combination of old school British spy films to modern day action espionage. The movie is unrealistic, predictable and ridiculous in some parts, but it is that in purpose, which makes it even a better film, really fun to watch and very entertaining. The acting is great, mainly by Samuel L. Jackson playing and excellent, original, eccentric, really cool and funny villain. The story is a little unoriginal, but itâ€™s nothing to be concerned about. Definitely, watch Kingsman, with no doubt. Real score: 8.6
5	The premise of this movie was great and I enjoyed it for the 1st hour. After that, it was all downhill. The movie is too long (2hr 9 min) and the fight scenes are interminable. When my husband stuck his hand out and mimed fast-forward, I knew it wasn't my girlie sensitivities. (He LOVES action/fight scenes.) It could have been fun, campy, action romp, but they wasted a perfectly good idea. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, really.
6	This movie was a decent movie that made fun of the old spy movies cliques but in a teen age twist . The villain was unique and interesting and the gadgets were good
7	Lets get straight to the point; it is worth watching in the theaters. This was a fun twist with unexpected humor. Though, I personally would loved to have seen more of the training program because the film does make you wonder how did they learn to fight so well. The music score wont be a best selling cd and I doubt that this film will be winning any Oscars but lets face it, Oscars would not be the reason why we would choose to watch this movie. This is a lets have a good time at the movies movie. As long as you can get past Samuel Jackson speech impediment. So go and enjoy.
10	This is a GREAT movie, if you liked ZombieLand you will like this. It is a Spy/Action/Comedy. SPOILERS!!! The Head explosion part at the end is AWESOME and hilarious. The only thing i think they could have done differently is the whole church scene maybe should have made it explain more why that happened and how.
4	I loved the setup, exposition, execution and concept of this movie in many ways which is why I'm so disappointed with how Kingsman ended up going lowbrow so often. What could have been a great start to an exciting new super-spy series is dragged down by tacky, sophomoric humor and gleeful violence that sometimes goes so absurdly off the rails that it overwhelms the excitement and the story. There were several times that my eyes rolled so far back that they practically fell out of my head. I understand that Sam Jackson's silly lisp and over the top scenery-chewing were part of an attempt to update the James Bond super-villain but for me it was distracting and outright annoying, causing me to dread his time on screen. Sadly, if Kingsman gets the sequel that it so clearly expects it's unlikely that they will use that opportunity to balance the elements; they'll have to out-do this film's excesses to appeal to it's intended audience of teenage boys who likely won't object.
0	This film is the most ridiculous rip-off of James Bond, Superman, Matrix, X-Men, even Star Trek, I've ever seen. Anyone who thought this was entertaining has no clue about quality writing, screenplay. James Bond rip offs were most atrocious and poorly done (got to dress properly, 'act' like James Bond, order your drink like bond (shaken, not stirred). As in Bond films, we are drawn through the showcasing of all the neat gadgets the hero will eventually use to do in the bad guys. The hero's persona was borrowed from the teen angst of the impulsive, smart, rawly talented likes of James T Kirk as late adolescent, the Superman-as-folksy-farm kid. Oh., but we need to have him prove out----we'll have him compete with other teen-young adult peers and 'win' the competition (see X-Men); and we need to throw in a strong heroine who has to depend on the hero for self-confidence and courage (make her good looking but never have her evidence any special talent or skill; but the main characters can't all be guys, right?). One of the worst rip-off films in the last 10 year; entertaining perhaps, if you have little movie-going history under your belt. Even the humor was ripped off ('.....you'll have to excuse me while I go save the world'). Emotional emphasis by all of the charactersswas totally reliant on using the f-word in every major scene (truly, this got to be dreadfully dull after the first hour.) We have to throw in the political issue of global warming as the impetus for the bad guy (who as we know, has limit-less wealth to do any evil he wants). I'd give the movie '1/2 of a 'star' ; and I wish to heck I could get my movie ticket money back on this one. You can skip this one if you have any historical memory of the Bond Series, Star Trek prequels, X-Men, Matrix. Anyone of you who have seen the above movies, sequels etc., could have written this thing----REALLLY!!! And, any single episode of these is 1000% better than this poorly written rip off.
9	Director Matthew Vaughn rejuvenates the spy genre with the gleefully over the top Kingsman: The Secret Service, a comical adaptation of Mark Millar's graphic novel that never let's go of humour and still delivers fast paced thrills.
9	Highly entertaining and loads of fun, 'Kingsman' is truly a refreshing parody of spy films and certainly a refreshing movie within the genre itself. In the years of bad to mediocre (at best) parodies, 'Kingsman' offers all of the classical elements of the genre but also add something new to the classical elements. Filled with effects, a surprisingly high quality of acting (Firth, Jackson and Strong are absolutely brilliant) and a vast amount of comedy, 'Kingsman' is a new James Bond version that surpasses all of the parodies that have used spy movies as a basis. Certainly something to be watched!
8	This movie is a fun movie that is unexpected, It is making fun of the 60s spy movies. The characters were also lovable and fleshed out. There were some iffy moments here and there, but the movie was amazing!
0	The sexual ending was completely out of phase with the whole tone and spirit of the movie up to that point ....I'm not a prude but it was just gratuitously tawdry, brought a so-so action flick down to completely 'un-recommendable' ... I was uncomfortable for half the people and families in the audience. I think it probably stifled word of mouth recommendations, this is not a movie a guy could bring a decent girl to , to say nothing about bringing a family ..... and really it had nothing what-so-ever to do with anything that had happened prior, it was a graphic anal sex bit that just really felt out of place and I don't see any of popular movie sites mentioning it.... fail all around
7	Although I enjoyed myself, I do think the film had some issues. The fast edited fight scenes go on way too long, it's really violent, and the film can't really decide if it's an all out comedy or drama. At times it has "Airplane" type of humor, like it's making fun of the spy genre, and other times heavy on the drama. At one point they even poke fun of product placement in movies with McDonalds, again showing the "Airplane" style of satirical humor. Somehow it all worked for me mainly due to the spirited acting by everyone involved. Not really a film I would desire to see again but fun for an afternoon.
9	Kingsman es de lejos, lo mejor que podrÃ¡s ver dentro del genero de acciÃ³n de este aÃ±o (por el momento) es una perfecta e inteligente pelicula de acciÃ³n que combina el espionaje de James Bond, la acciÃ³n grotesca, bizarra, sangrienta y fantasiosa de Quentin Tarantino y con toques frescos de suspenso y comedia. Matthew Vaughn ya nos tiene acostumbrados a ver sus excelentes adaptaciones de cÃ³mic a cine (Kick Ass, X-Men First Class) Kingsman es una de esas, solo que con un estilo un poco diferente, pero fiel al cÃ³mic.
9	So Fifty shades of F***ing Sh*t top this movie at the box office where 50 shades got everything wrong and there's nothing good about it, but Kingsman got a lot of good things to talk about so at the end of the day Kingsman win. The story is about a street-wise punk with a set of fast hands (and a faster mouth), finds himself recruited by an underground spy agency. If he can pass their test, he will be one of the new initiated into their ranks - just a threat from a twisted tech genius threatens the world. Every since the first trailer for this movie came out I already known that this movie was going to be great because Matthew Vaughn directing it and that guy knows how to make a well made film that reminds everyone what good movies are, and that's why these no surprise that this movie was awesome. Kingsman: The Secret Service is a like tribute to good spy films that seem to be serious or not very well made these day, yeah they where cheesy and goof but that's what we remember best from them and this movie was the perfect tribute to that, and a perfect tribute that everybody isn't going to see because everybody is going to see 50 Shades of Rubbish, I just lose faith in humility after that. Matthew Vaughn to me is a director who knows how to direct good action scenes and knows how to entertain the audience, and with this movie he directed this with style and a enough effort to make a bad-ass film, even when his movies mostly flop at the box office it will have a cult following and Kingsman will have a cult following. Nice work Matthew Vaughn. Jack Davenport who is a new star and this is his first big role his every been in and my god was he great in this movie. This is my first time I ever seen this guy act and let me tell you this guy has a bright future a head for him. Now at the first I didn't really thought that Colin Firth kicking ass would work, but after seeing the movie I was wrong..dead wrong. Every time Colin Firth was in a action scenes I bought it because I heard in a article that he did all of his stunts and I got to say he pulled it of brilliantly. His character Harry Hart was the best character in the whole film and every time his on screen he stole the whole film for me. Samuel L. Jackson has the villain was just spot on brilliant, I mean talking about a villain that was fun and freaking hilarious. But at the first I wasn't very sure about the way he talked in the film, he talked like Adam Snadler from WaterBoy, but after a while I got use to it and it worked for his character. These days I feel that Samuel L. Jackson is just filling it in with his new movies, but in this I actually sawed him playing and caring about his character and he knocked it out of the park. This movie probably has one of the best action scene I've seen since...I'm not kidding you here but The Matrix, and that's the Church scene. May god way do I even begin with this, the scene itself was fast paste but I still could see what was going on and that action scene was shot beautifully well and it showed what action should be filmed. So watch when you see the film look out for the Church scene it will not disappoint. Now for problems and I only have some: I got to say that the first couple of minutes of the movie I didn't really get sucked in into the movie that much, but as the movie went along I finally got into it. Overall Kingsman is a movie that deserves more attraction, skip 50 Shade of Whatever and see this movie, trust me this movie is more well made than 50 shades.
10	The negative reviews here take life and this movie too seriously. This was a great tongue in cheek movie. It was less graphic than kill bill and the "gore" was very clean gore. Arm gets cut off no spraying blood. It was a great have fun, sit back and enjoy the ride movie. It isn't going to win an Oscar but quite frankly I never like those movies anyway. So stop trying to make movies into political statements and enjoy. I also thought the final scene was just funny. Those people who said that they wouldn't take their kids to it should look at the rating.
2	Terrible movie, rude. Did I mention rude? Ridiculous overkill, ridiculous lisp, ridiculous premise. Wish I never saw it, or took my friends to see it. Money back purchase???
4	Could have been really great - but pointlessly/unnecessarily graphic violence demeans it. Trying too hard to be like Game of Thrones or 300 - limits the market The Firth, Jackson, & Caine bits (i.e. script) - brilliant!
6	This movie is stupid. The action is cartoony, blood, excessively violent, and over the top. Most of the characters in this film are clichÃ©s and the story is filled with tons of tropes and clichÃ©s that youâ€™ve seen before but its so much bloody fun! Samuel L. Jackson is fun and over the top as the villain. The action is a blast to watch for all the reasons I just said and the humor is good providing some good laughs and clever satire. This is a film that I didnâ€™t expect much out of and Iâ€™m glad I did because I was pleasantly surprised by how much fun it was. Every year that is that big dumb action movie that is a lot of fun last year it was Guardians of the Galaxy, the year before it was Pacific Rim, this year it is Kingsmen. We are in the dry season and dumping ground of film where nothing great comes out as I eagerly await the two or three good films that will come out in the summer while waiting for the last quarter when all the best films will likely come out. In such a time a fun film like Kingsmen is welcomed with upon arms. This probably wonâ€™t be on my Top 10 list this year but will definitely get an honorable mention because it was a fun movie with a lot of memorable scenes, jokes, and characters.
0	I can not begin to describe how horrible this movie is. The premise is childish. The characters are stereotypical and annoying and the gratuitous violence is beyond disgusting. If you enjoy blood and guts every five minutes by all means knock yourself out. The previews of the movie bear no resemblance at all to what the movie is about other than the fact that it tries to be a cheeky homage to James Bond. Two thirds of the way through the movie I walked out. While waiting on my partner to finish watching it I looked up the ending on line. Glad i made the decision to leave. If you are a thirteen year old boy with anger issues will you love this movie. I would give more details but I might have a spoiler and I don't want anyone to miss the message of how infantile, disgusting and just plain bad this movie is.
7	'Kingsman: The Secret Service' is the latest movie directed by Matthew Vaughn who made it big in the directing world with films such as; 'Layer Cake' (2004), 'Stardust' (2007), 'Kick-Ass' (2010) and his most popular 'X-Men: First Class' (2011). I think I heard that he was one of the many directors attached to the latest "Star Wars" movie at one point, but he decided to do this. All I am going to say is this...it is the month of February and you know what that means, if you are a "Movie Buff" like me, you'll know that February is the death month of cinema, a month where nothing goo comes out. Yes, I am looking at YOU 'Fifty Shades of Grey' (2015). Luckily, "Kingsman" is actually one of the best movies that has come out this entire month. The movie focuses on a secret spy agency which is led by a legendary spy named Gallahad (Colin Firth) who meets a young man named Eggsy (Taron Edgerton) who grows up and joins the secret service. The main villain in this movie is played by a very funny and charismatic Samuel L. Jackson who speaks with a lisp. His main plan is to make everybody switch to a SIM card that will supposedly corrupt the rest of the civilians. The cast also includes Michael Caine and Mark Strong in very sophisticated performances. This movie reminded me of 'Hot Fuzz' (2007), the high octane violence and British feel to the movie took me back to that movie. It's very funny, but it's still strong in the storytelling arc, and still very thoughtful despite the over-the-top violence. I'll admit, the movie isn't exactly perfect (then again, no movie is), it does get a little cliche towards the third act and, without spoiling too much, when one main character doesn't return, it does get a little routine. But it's still lively and very funny. I wouldn't necessarily say to go see "Kingsman" at the cinema, it is worth waiting to rent, but if you want to upstage "Fifty Shades" in terms of box office gross, watch this movie as many times as you can. I have not seen 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and I don't plan on to, I'm glad I spent my money on this, even if it did get a little underwhelming. I do have a gut feeling that "Fifty Shades" will unfortunately upstage "Kingsman" in the box office, but hey, to reassure any of you, you'd be glad to know that on Rotten Tomatoes, so far, "Fifty Shades" has an embarrassing 25% rating, while "Kingsman" has a much better rating of 74%. Get in!!! Manners, Maketh, Man.
9	A weekend cinema-outing of this slick UK spy actioner which is a surprisingly excellent revamped Bond-esque espionage genre fare inundated with polished set pieces and beguiling plot twist albeit the whole movie is ground in the same old saving-the-world-from-a-supervillain mode. Director Matthew Vaughn has been constantly on my radar as one of my favourite genius in commercial filmmaking, I have watched all his previous four features, from LAKE CAKE (2004, 6/10), X-MEN: FIRST CLASS (2011, 7/10), to my absolute guilty-pleasure treasures STARDUST (2007, 9/10) and KICK-ASS (2010, 9/10). His latest is by all means a thoroughly engaging adventure with unconventional violence and visual gags, which all delightfully surpass viewerâ€™s expectation. keep reading my review on my blog, google: cinema omnivore.
9	great movie. characters are great, action scenes are well done, and humorous at times, but can be serious. overall there are few faults in this incredible movie.
9	It's difficult for me to just dole out a 10 rating on any movie unless I'm awe-stricken. This movie deserves a very reasonable 9 because it delivers what movies should and that is entertainment. Screenplay was well written and the acting was very good. Well worth the time & money to go see
8	Before I saw this film, I thought it was just going to be another British action film with an occasional familiar face. But I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't so. The film has a very unique plot with emotional and comedic vibes that mix perfectly, along with loads of violence and controversial elements that make this film great! I definitely recommend this film.
3	Dumb movie, I guess if you like something with no plot, stupid pathetic writing that a 10 year old could do better than watch this movie. Or you could just watch the grass grow, would be just as good
7	Alright be careful when you watch this movie. Stay away from having that 007/hardcore secret agent mindset and loosen up because there's plenty of comedy peppered in. I first want to say that Colin Firth was a good choice and I expect alot of good work from him. Also, it almost seems like a gimmick that Samuel Jackson was portrayed but he DID NOT disappoint guys. I didn't really pay attention to the music this time but like I mentioned earlier don't expect the trademark 007 stuff. Let's talk about the comedy real quick. I didn't laugh much at all and the movie really laid out a lot of forced humor. So them trying to impress me and sway me from focusing on the movie and its holes....Nooooo sir, I got my eye on you sneaky screenwriters. The action and choreography was solid, and I do think it could've been a lot better as it relied on technology alot to wow the audience. One thing I liked is the historical context and detail to current events and this movie did that so I appreciate that. I would like to write more about certain holes iin this movie maybe in the plot or the character development but I want people that have not watched this to read this first. You're going to have a good time watching this and I recommend watching it with a friend. The directing and camera is above average so if you're into that aspect of film, be prepared to be pleased.
6	one thing sadly missing from this film is a bit of uniqueness of Iggsy . I think it could have been more original with a troubled young lesbian. Some of the CGI needed more work on but this was more of a endeavor than other MARV films. With all the anal jokes Iggsy could've of been a deep in the closet gay young man maybe they could explore more of this subtext in next films . Overall well done
9	It's been awhile since I've done a review so I might as well go for the low hanging fruit for now. Kingsmen is a fantastic movie with great directing, a well rounded cast and awesome action scenes. The plot is your standard spy movie fair, with one or two twists thrown in for good measure. Matthew Vaughn's streak of really fun movies continues.
4	Funny, visually appealing and entertaining, I was willing to forgive a host of obvious directorial concessions to the intended 14-year-old chav boy audience until the gratuitous anal sex scene at the end ruined it â€“ vulgar, unnecessary, and totally contradictory to the central message of what being a â€œGentleman / Real Manâ€? is all about. A real pity it f^
7	This film's occasionally cheap looking CGI, juvenile humour and preposterous situations are all easily forgiven by quick witted dialogue and pitch perfect performances. Kingsmen revels in its self aware humour, paying homage to the spy movies of old without descending into pastiche. Like a James Bond film written by a 10 year old boy, it is far more engaging and entertaining than it has any right to be!
10	There is much to like about this movie. In particular, Colin Firth. This film goes to show what a versatile actor he truly is. Love the gentleman kick-ass style. And while the movie does have more than it's fair share of violence; the gore is not over-the-top. It is best to keep in mind that this movie deals in extremes. If you are easy offended, this one may not be for you. However, if you can roll with the punches and see this for the dark comedy that it is, kick your heals up and enjoy. It's a hell of a ride.
8	This is essentially a fun, modernized, homage to the 60s bond films. However, do not confuse this with the old bond films it's far crazier than any bond film i've ever seen. All in all Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth are great. So if you've ever wondered what that would be like this is your film.
8	It is agent movie but not like the James Bond movie. It talks about the secret service in a slightly realistic manner. Agents will actually die and require replacement. And the new agent is needed to be trained. The villain is actually smart and logical but not ethical. The philosophy behind the villain is not completely wrong which is a balance between heroes and villains which is good. Likewise, due to that minor realistic, there will be blood, chopping people off, stuff like that. In the meantime, there will be some boring car chasing and explosion scene which I do not care at all. The black comedy at the end was quit impressive. Overall, it is a light movie. I will definitely watch it again....
0	Man! I wanted this movie to be a good one. Good plot, great actors, wa wa wa-horribly unnecessary violence and gore. Disgusting. Oh, and to top off the end, nasty and lude sexual script and more visual than you wanted---GROSS GROSS GROSS! Too bad!
9	Kingsman does good everything it wants to do, it is funny when intended to be, and the action is really good, the movie has great actors. I loved it.
9	The Kingsman, a movie I really didn't expect to be THIS good, stars one of my all time favorite actors as the main Villain, Samuel L Jackson. I went in expecting a pretty good movie. What I got was one of the best movies I've seen in the last two years. The movie has extremely over the top gore, and an almost parody like feeling to James Bond movies. The humor is extremely solid, with almost every single joke getting a good laugh out of me. And unlike mindless action movies such as Furious 7, this movie had a pretty engaging plot. Everyone in the movie gave in excellent performance, and the musical score fit each scene just perfectly. Go see this movie if you haven't had the chance, and even if you still aren't sure, it's a for sure purchase on blueray.
5	Gratuitous pornography at the end. Spoiled the movie for me. I was totally enjoying it up until that point. I wish movie makers would understand it was unnecessary and now I can't buy the movie. Otherwise it was very fun. If it didn't have that, I would've ignored the cussing, rated the movie highly and bought it. It was OK for teenagers to cuss in it but adults should not.
8	'Kingsman; The Secret Service' is a high octane, blockbuster, wrapped in a thick layer of enthusiasm and solid production value. And when It comes down to pure film-making; 'Kingsman" is hard to gripe about - with worm, delicate photography - sharp editing & a cleanly paced screenplay By Jane Goldman & Matthew Vaughn that gives each character a moment to shine. As well as being refreshingly original with non-generic or formulaic character tropes / archetypes, you've seen a thousand times before; I give it an 8/10 & recommend it for a great time at the theater.
10	Good Acting, great fight scenes. Me and my better half both enjoyed the story, the acting, and the flow of action. Would love to see this one go 3+ movies more in their franchise.
3	Obnoxiously violent. Newcomer Taron Edgerton shows some promise, but it is otherwise a blood-bath of a film. Not my taste at all, in the end. I can see the appeal to others, but not my favourite movie experience.
8	I can use 1 word to describe this movie and that word is fun, which is the best praise you can give a movie. Sure it's violent and sure it's not the best spy movie out there, but you can tell it wasn't trying to be. All it was trying to do was please the audience. if you plan on watching a movie with sophistication then you might want to stay away from this film because from start to end this movie is a blood bath. In conclusion if your looking for something that isn't sophisticated but is just fun then this is the movie for you.
10	Most likely one of the best movies of the year. It was excellent. The more you watch it the more you observe things that you were initially not aware of. I recommend it wholeheartedly, can't wait for the next one. It is anything but boring or predictable.
6	Mildly entertaining. Was a bit long given the weakness of the premise of the movie. Lost a point for the stupidity of what the sim cards made people do.
7	Kingsman is a sick movie that truly delivers. But it could have been even better. I actually did expect a lot more action. The trailers did ruin the movie a bit. I had higher expectations than what the movie gave me. The action though, is epic and a hell of a ride! The music is very fitting and the humor is freaking awesome. The plot is great and sick as it should be. Other than that is it cool, epic but an overrated movie. But it's still great to watch, and I will do it again soon!. 7.8/10
7	It's certainly far from Vaughn's best work, however, Kingsman overcomes disappointingly unfunny gags with its sheer watchability and impeccably executed action.
8	I was shocked with how violent and vulgar Kingsman was after seeing the promo. The film has some great action scenes and you really felt for the characters. You could see that none of them were invincible throughout the movie. I really liked Colin Firth, I think he definitely the best character in the movie. Taron Egerton had a great breakout performance and I think we'll be seeing him in some blockbusters in the future. The one thing was I was a little disappointed by was Samuel L Jackson's performance as the villain. It was just kind of the same performance he always does only he was trying imitate Mike Tyson. Other than that I thought the movie was enjoyable and I hope we see another one.
7	Kingsman might be one of the surprise hits of 2015. I didn't see that coming. I got a lot of fun when I watched it. Glad that there are going to be a sequel.
10	Loved Colin Firth in this as well as Michael Caine too but I am so over Samuel L Jackson being all over the place in recent movies. He bogarts too much screen time when there are other younger and better actors who could have delivered the bad guy better in this film.
0	Der Film ist brutal und das wird noch mit 80/90er Jahre Musik untermalt und mit buntem Feuerwerk gefeiert. Geschmackloser gehts wohl kaum noch. Oftmals vorgespult, weil es unnÃ¶tig brutal ist.
9	You will find extreme over-the-top violence, hilarious moments, and upsetting deaths in Kingsman: The Secret Service. This is one of the best spy movies ever made and even the villain is funny. Harry's death is sad. Overall, don't take kids under 13 to see this as the violence is pretty brutal(especially the church scene). The McDonalds scene is also pretty funny.
9	an eccentric action-packed movie, with a pinch comedy, and a truly epic entertainment. the only -1 for this movie is the visual effect on some scenes need smoothing.
8	Good, good, good. As a straight up action film, Kingsman is awesome. Add some humor, an interesting plot, and good acting, and these round off an excellent film. Sam Jackson's lisp is hilarious (especially between swearing), the church scene is spectacular, and the break dance fighting at the end is great. Sequel... seeequueeeellll!!!!!!
7	Tonally and thematically this film is more than a bit of a mess, but that doesn't keep it from being steadily entertaining. With its more hit than miss humor, hyper-stylized and choreographed violence and a solid performance by Colin Firth, it's got enough going for it to distract the viewer from its shortcomings.
10	This movie is one of the best action/spy movies since Skyfall (but a lot more fun). The comedy behind the story is hilarious, and the action is over the top and wonderful. I loved the storyline, and it is a very visually appealing picture. I enjoyed this from start to finish, and it was still able throw some twists in to change it up. I would love to see a sequel sometime soon.
6	"Kingsman: The Secret Service" has exhilarating choreography and witty performances, but the movie plays it too safe, which is kind of disappointing. Still fun to watch though... 6.5/10.
10	brilliant film not stop action and humor from start to finish well written well acted well played if you like your spy movies with a bit of humor but not to much to take away the seriousness this is for your
8	Some jerkoff "professional" reviewers have managed to bring down the critic score on this, but trust me, I don't even like comic book movies and I loved this. It's what the Triple A 100 billion dollar comic movies should strive to be.
8	This is not bad,it's good! The really enjoy the film with it's cool action and a funny spy movie.The film has some issues and plot holes but still love the film.It is enjoyable action spy movie with Violence on top of it.
8	Kingsman the Secret service was such a fun movie. Great action, storytelling, performances from actors and humor that makes for such a great movie watching experience. There isn't a lot i could say that was about about this film, the blood and gore was a little bit excessive for my taste but that is a minor point. Kingsman is a great spy movie that I highly recommend to anyone.
8	Great movie, great acting, great humor, great violence! I really liked how this movie was something else, something out of the ordinary, it has it's cliches, but it's funny and entertaining! Go and watch it, you'll love it!
8	Iâ€™ll be honest. I was expecting of a really grounded spy movie which unfortunately, it isnâ€™t. It was probably because I was expecting a compelling plot with a great back story or something. However, just because itâ€™s not a grounded spy movie doesnâ€™t mean I didnâ€™t enjoy it. I loved it actually! I liked how this movie is a homage to the earlier spy movies but it still stands as its own movie. The movie had a meta moment when it discusses how two of the characters in the movie (in which I wonâ€™t spoil) missed how fun spy movies used to be and now current spy movies are too serious. With the homage as well as the meta moment, this movie is going to delight spy movie fans more. While this movie doesnâ€™t have a compelling plot, the movie does a good job developing the main character Eggsy played by Taron Egerton. The father-son dynamic between Eggsy and Harry (played by Colin Firth) is excellent. The humor is quite dark, witty and funny. Valentine (played by Samuel L. Jackson) delivered the funniest lines in the movie with Harry being the close second. The action scenes were excellently shot and choreographed and this is from someone who doesnâ€™t generally care about action scenes. Itâ€™s one of the best strengths of the movie that kept my eyes on the screen. Kingsman: The Secret Service will satisfy the spy genre fans more but this movie is still fun for the general audience like me who wants a good yet fun movie.
9	From the action scene in the trailer, I was pumped to see this movie. I went in hoping for an action packed, kick ass movie with great comedic moments. I was not remotely disappointed. The characters are generic, but that makes them easy to understand with so little backstory to go on. The action is crazy, the comedy comes naturally, and their are some genuinly innovative ideas here. It's such a great time that it made me feel the rare urge to hope for a sequel. Even without though, it's an outstanding rush for the senses
6	Enjoyable movie. Refreshing. Certainly better than all those James Bond movies. Violence is bit extreme in a couple of scenes, but it is toned down by lack of too much blood. Anyway, you cannot have the plot of the movie presented properly without the violence.
7	I went into Chappie expecting to fully hate it, as I am not a big fan of Neil Blomkamp and his lack of subtlety when dealing with social differences. But once I realized this was more a science fiction action comedy more than a political diatribe, I was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, this is not a great movie by any standard, but it is extremely entertaining. In fact, I'd say it's Blomkamp's best in my books. It doesn't take itself too seriously and decides to go for action comedy rather than half baked pseudo socio-political commentary. The movie is at it's best when it embraces the silliness and fully goes with it, as the sappy drama and the social insight feel very unpolished. Additionally, a lot of the acting from the Die Antwoord band members is sub par, and Hugh Jackman, plays a ridiculously artificial caricature of an antagonist. But as style rules over realism, these conflicts are easily ignored. Not nearly as self serious, ridiculously moralistic or grotesquely caricaturesque as District 9 or Elysium, and a much better movie for it.
10	I've been shocked by reviews before, but I have never been more blown away than by the critical response of Chappie. This movie is damn near perfect. I think it might be the South African sensibility of the whole movie. This is one of the most fundamentally sound films I've seen in a very long time. It's an action-comedy love letter to the musical duo Die Antwoord. I'm a Die Antwoord fan but even if I wasn't I would understand what Blomkamp was trying to do. This was like a modern day Yellow Submarine with more movie than music and Die Antwoord doesn't suck at acting like the Beatles did. Ninja and Yolandi were actually very solid actors for this being their first film. The rest of the cast crushed it because they're all incredibly talented especially Patel. I hear a lot about Jackman's two dimensional villain and how bad it was, but that's what kind of movie this is. It's a serious movie that never takes itself too seriously. I swear to Science that film critics these days are so far up their own a***s that they wouldn't know a good movie if it puked in their face. Chappie is a solid flick and deserves praise. I think Die Antwoord should be praised for how solid they were in this movie.
4	As I was watching this, the one thing that kept standing out to me was just how amazing the CG was. It was really hard to tell when it was CG and when it was a model which is a testament to the post-production work. That's about where the praise ends for this. When it got to the end I was thinking "why didn't you focus on that aspect the whole time?!" It was frustrating to watch and a little irritating because I've liked Blomkamps work so far (District 9 being excellent and Elysium being decent). This movie has a cool concept that goes into a completely different concept and then loses itself half-way through with plotting. There's really a lot going on but not a whole lot happening. It's frustrating and ultimately a let down.
10	A sense of belonging seems to be writer/director/producer Neill Blomkampâ€™s greatest asset when it comes to filmmaking. The man behind the revered District 9 picks up the pieces of his fumbled second feature film Elysium by introducing us to the second cutest robot to ever grace the silver screen, Chappie. If you are wondering who managed to snatch the first place title of cutest robot to hit the big screen, I would easily argue Wall-E as the clear champion, albeit, animation (as well as Disney) have a fantastic way of bringing out the cute in everything, even a teapot. Luckily for audiences and movie-goers, Chappie is different; Chappie is real: Chappie is alive and Chappie is very much one of the best things to happen to the year 2015 in film. Blomkamp again introduces us to a world not far off from the one we live in today. Launching his story in his hometown Johannesburg, South Africa, local police are shown to have begun implementing a robotic policing force, known as the Scout program, from a weapons corporation Tetravaal. Its creator, Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), has been successful in creating easily operated and incorruptible weapons for the greater good, but we quickly learn that Deon is in search of something more â€“ artificial intelligence and the creation of the first living, feeling sentinel being. While Blomkampâ€™s film relies heavily on action, visual effects, and character development, Chappie can easily be hailed as the directorâ€™s most personal, emotional, and sentimental feature film. Never shying away from very real and often times imaginative social commentaries set within uncomfortable and contemporary political setting, Blomkamp wastes no time in introducing Chappie, developing his character as much (if not more) than any other human being seen on screen. Hot off the heals of a very painful and personal failed program, ex-soldier turned engineered Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) is persistent to prove Wilsonâ€™s Scout program as a failure, never being able to trust or rely on artificial intelligence. Deeming the program unpredictable, and arguing the ethics of A.I with that of a human being and the morality, ethics and fine fabrics that make man, Moore sets up the film for its greatest and deepest commentary. The very essence of Chappie relies heavily between the conflicts and struggles of two very real people: Deon and Vincent, and how their creations used for the greater good become catalysts to eliminate crime in a violently filled South African capital. Yet, throughout Chappie, the greatest animalistic behaviours and torn examples of violence, inhumanity and injustice/crime are seen by human beings. Moore spends most of the film trying to deceit and ruin Wilson, from nothing more than we can understand as revenge and jealousy, allowing us to pose the questions: would we want this man governing and policing our streets? Are these the beginnings of corruption? In addition to these scenes of treacherous human behaviour, the realest and most humane scenes of the film are those, almost exclusively, involving Chappie. From a quiet and sad encounter with a dog, to a very confused and apologetic encounter with a bleeding police officer on a bridge during a heist, to his many interactions with his â€œmakerâ€? Deon, Chappie shines with the most unwavering signs of humanity and moral justice. The underlining context of Blomkamp could easily be observed for many viewings, which makes Chappie, a robot with a bright orange â€œrejectâ€? sticker across his forehead, one of the most brilliant and under-apprecaited films of 2015, deserving of being seen at least twice. Thankfully, although Chappie may be credited as being the most human character in the film, despite the simple fact that he is indeed a robot, he is not the only interesting individual. Endearing robot aside, Blomkampâ€™s emotionally rich and deeply subconscious film is filled with fascinating characters. The two roles bound to be the most talked about make up the duo that will determine whether or not people enjoy the film. Of course, the pair is none other than Chappieâ€™s Mommy and Daddy: Ninja and Yolandi (Watkin Tudor Jones and Anri du Toit or, better known as, Ninja and Yo-Landi in the rap/synth South African musical duo Die Antwoord). Quite possibly the biggest reason Chappie may not be a success nor treated as the bravest science fiction film of 2015, is the inclusion of Die Antwoord. As it was for myself once I got wind of the casting choice, their involvement may be a real mystery to viewers. Truthfully, I wasnâ€™t fully able to understand their significance being cast up until the rolling of the end credits, ironically enough, while their song Cookie Thumper! penetrated my ear lobes. Blomkamp, a master filmmaker whose obsession with analyzing and capturing the essence of reality and significance of his hometown upbringing, truly brings a unique commentary about lower class societies and gangster culture.

9	In my opinion , this film is better than Elysium . but worse than district 9. I just don't quite get why there is so much negative critic reviews. Most of them try to find some inner meanings in Chappie. Other just say that Chappie setting is similar to the District 9. IMHO , it's just a SCI-FI fairytale with artificial intelligence and robots, which tells us how hard it is to become a MAN nowadays. P.s. Ninja and Yolandi are awesome !
6	What's advertised as an action film is actually a somewhat soppy sentimental story. Future Johannesburg is patrolled by a force of mechanized police that have restored order to the crime-ridden streets. A trio of criminals ends up with a rogue robot that's been programmed with consciousness, giving it a child's innocent mindset. Instead of cool fights, there's lots of rash dialogue, hurried activity and numerous efforts to create an endearing creature out of Chappie. The South African duo from Die Antwoord, who have major roles, are raw and unusual looking, but not especially strong as actors. There are fallacies in the logic that border on ridiculous and only one good final battle (with yet another machine). Still, director Neill Blomkamp manages to keep it interesting and the creation of the robot itself is pretty compelling.
10	Chappie was the best movie I have ever seen since Tron: legacy, the Hobbit and the dark knight. I highly recommend that every body should go see chappie. If you like action chappie has. If you like emotional movies chappie has it.
8	Niell Blomkamp has outdone himself in Chappie. I couldn't disagree more with the people calling the movie, "A washed up version of district 9" or a failed remake of some other popular science fiction movie. The grit infused into the movie is almost tangible as Blomkamp finally delivers a believable dystopian South Africa. Hugh Jackman's performance is stellar. His role as a paranoid ex-military man was flawless. Niell shows a future South African drug gang society that is as much captivating as it is frightening while somehow dispelling needless violence. Even with an R rating for language and violence, none of it is misplaced. Character development was done well also, giving not just "enough of" an arc for every main character but instead completing their story in a fulfilling way. My only complaint has to do with the "gangster" sideways shooting method that Watkin Jones teaches Chappie in one scene. However I do not want to oversell the movie either. There's a few reasons I didn't give it a ten or even a nine. But go see for yourself. You wont be sorry you did.
8	Now, I'm confused. Should I choose Baymax or Chappie? The first moment the movie started, "Who made the soundtrack?".... HANS ZIMMER!!!!! My ears never failed. ....but Dev Patel is SO HANDSOME!!!! HIS ACTING IS AWESOME!!!!! I ADORE HIM SUDDENLY! PUUURFECT! It's just the whole great things in this movie like being so messed up, like we don't know which one is right or wrong side anymore. It feels like Nightcrawler. Then there's Wall-E feels... and Transcendence. (It's extremely better than Transcendence! Come on, Critics! It's worth green score!) Well, but Chappie gave me better enjoyment until ending, laugh-sad-thrill-confused-happy all the feelings. Stay still on my seat, that's a big deal. The big star for the movie is truly Dev Patel. Well done. 3.5/5 For the climax ending (though there's hospital option, but well) For the all feelings I experienced For the music For Dev Patel.ï»¿
9	Chappie is a very creative and thought provoking film from the Director of District 9 and Elysium. It covers the topic of human Consciousness and Artificial intelligence in robots witch some films may have done in the past, But none make you feel this attached to the characters involved. Watching Chappie's intelligence evolve like that of a child's but faster is what really makes you feel compassion and attached to him. Chappie really steals the spotlight in this film but the other stars Huge Jackman ,Sigourney Weaver and "Die Antwoord" who all do a sufficient job but the acting of "Ninja & Yolandi"(Die Antwood) could use some work. The direction of the action scenes are done with great camera angles, Loud powerful audio and beautiful CGI, Even the way Chappie interacts with his environment is seamless. If you have seen District 9 or Elysium I'm quite sure you will enjoy this film. Director Neill Blomkamp really knows how to bring his vision to life and make it looks great in the process.
8	Chappie has gotten mixed reviews, but I think it is mostly because people come in expecting it to be some action robot fighting movie or a super realistic robot movie. Instead of being a pure robot action movie, they try to take on the when does something become truly alive. If a mechanical device becomes self aware and has the ability to learn in its own, should it be thought of like a human. The concept is not be all that new. Everything from Blade Runner to Ghose In The Shell has hit the same basic concepts. If can except some of the stretches in science used in the movie and do not mind some pacing issues with for the most part predictable characters and story lines, this should be a good movie to watch. It is much better than movies like Lawnmower Man and Transcendence which take on the idea of transferring a soul or mind from one body to another. The acting was good on average. It was nice to see Hugh Jackman take on a bad guy role. It is just to bad it was a very common bad guy role. Sigourney Weaver also delivered a very cliche character. I think both Jackman and Weaver could have been pushed to make their characters more unique. If you are looking for a mindless action movie, this is not it. If you liked Blade Runner or you love all things SCi-Fi, then this is worth seeing in theaters.
7	I had pretty low expectations because of the scores all over the internet, but the movie turned out to be okayish. I didn't like all that Die Antwoord stuff, just too much of it. Also there were some lame points in the story, but overall I mostly enjoyed the movie.
9	I don't get the **** negative press. Pros: Action, Sci Fi. Cons: Action, Sci Fi. It seems like all these **** old-head ass reviewers want is civil rights movie after civil rights movie, and WWII movie after WWII movie.
10	The critics are snobs, dont read them. Amazing movie, I never post here or any review sites but seeing the harsh critics I had to. Great plot, some minor annoyance there, but all payed for by the chappie character who you grow with and love.
10	Apparently this is just a movie everyone needs to see and judge for themselves. I am SERIOUSLY baffled by the negative reception from critics! I loved this movie, and I thought it was a very well done analysis of consciousness and self/self-identity. A beautiful coming-of-age film. What impressed me most about this film was that I didn't feel like I was watching a smart robot come to self awareness, but, rather, I was watching a consciousness come to self realization. Chappie's development in the film was impressively organic. Often robot movies like this one suffer from too many eureka moments and light-bulb-above-the-head cliches: the problem with these cliches, is they don't reflect how living consciousness grows as we experience it in humans (our only reference point). Chappie really feels like a human consciousness, just trying to learn how to live the best he can. Chappie does not feel like a robot learning that he is alive, which is appropriate since, as a consciousness, his "alive-ness" is taken for granted from birth. The film really moved me, and I was in tears several times. The action was also great, as was ALL the acting. The narrative was, in fact, solid, even if it wasn't revolutionary. It told the story it needed to. Directing was also well done. I would give this film a 9, but it moved me so much, that I feel I owe it a 10. Can't wait to see it again! Really underrated. I am confident that in time this movie will be more well liked. This may be a case of expectations ruin the movie? I really don't know.
9	Wasn't expecting this to be as funny as it was, haven't laughed this hard in ages, actual comedies these days don't come close to it. It does have a slow start and some Dev Patel acting was a little off but once Chappie gets going you will laugh for 20mins straight in the middle.
4	I wanted to like this movie so bad. There was so much potential. But sadly, Chappie is a giant mess with terrible characters, wasted actors, and a message that gets confused within itself. At least Chappie himself is a solid character and the cinematography is good, because that's about all this film has.
9	The most fun I've had at the movies so far this year. Beautiful visually with amazing action sequences and a lot of humor. Don't believe the negative hype machine. See it and judge for yourself.
0	This movie is absolutely terrible. The acting is unprofessional, its worse than a direct to dvd title. The writing is horrible, hard to believe anyone greenlight it. On top of that is the shameless and crass product placement. Sony Pictures represents everything wrong with the movie industry with movies like Jack and Jill, The Smurfs 1 and 2, Grown Ups 1 and 2, and The Amazing Spiderman 2.
9	It speaks volumes about how I connected this film and the character of Chappie that I felt more for him than more than half of human characters I have encountered in my cinematic journey thus far. At points, I genuinely felt very afraid for Chappie but equally touched with his, arguably, naive humanity towards other living things. And to those critics who complain about the plot hole or contrivances - I am willing to bet that a few of the so called classics they would put in their personal favourites have their fair few plot holes in them! Stuff you 'professional' critics, I really enjoyed this one!
6	After the disappointment of 'Elysium', 'Chappie' at the very least marks somewhat of a return towards the successful style of 'District 9' even though it falls very short to Blomkamp's stellar debut. The thing about 'Chappie' is that it is a film of great moments and depth but riddled with some bizarre choices in the storytelling that serves to undo all the great work that Blomkamp manages to achieve. The character of 'Chappie' himself is a technical triumph and just oozes life and feels natural within the landscape whilst also providing the film with its main source of charm and comedy. But the most glaringinly odd choice that Blomkamp makes with this is having the main character supported by 3 unlikeable criminals who then act as the main focus of the narrative instead of the more obvious character Deon (Dev Patel). It's such a strange choice especially since initially there appears to be nothing redeemable about them and intially it doesn't work at all. However by the films climax, you do kind of feel a connection to them and their relationship with Chappie somehow seems to 'redeem' them by the time all hell breaks loose without you even realising it. It's all rather odd and just screams out as a bad idea and yet somehow it does work even though I would say that Chappie's relationship with Deon feels rather forced in comparison and doesn't really need to be there. The action is better, the characters are more interesting in spite of the issues I mentioned but I do feel that too much is going on at different times and I feel that the balance isn't quite there. It's definitely not a disaster by any means and while I look forward to Blomkamp's upcoming Alien film, 'Chappie' is a fair indicator that Blomkamp isn't quite the one hit wonder some might have feared.
1	I can't believe how dumb everyone is giving this movie above a 5... This movie is anything but original and has no sense of reality. So the movie rips off Short Circuit especially at the end of the movie. The plot is basically the same as district 9, but instead of human becomes alien with alien companion, human becomes robot with robot companion. I found the opening scene to be the only good part of the movie, I'd rather watch a mindless robot action movie than this crap. If you've scene short circuit 1 and 2 and district 9, you know this movie already. So the engineer that created Chappie checked out the god key which is needed to do software updates on his scouts, takes it out of the secure building with his broken scout and no one notices anything with cameras every where... Calls him several days later about the key "Hey you checked the god key out several days ago." and his response is "I know I took it home with me to do some work." WHAT THE **** His security clearance would be revoked immediately, he'd be tracked down and arrested so fast. No one realizes there is a rogue police robot (Chappie) running around stealing cars until he does a heist stealing money from a bank truck. Oh and the character Mommy dies and at the end shows her conscience is saved to a flash drive like anyone cares that she died. OMG Don't tell me they are making a sequel.... This movie is based around low-life gangsters and their retarded ways of talking, looking cool, and being badass. This movie is garbage. To sum it all up go see the first action scene then get your money back. That is the only part worth watching. Short Circuit 1 and 2 and District 9 = This Crappie movie. Woops I meant Chappie. Wait no I had it right, it's Crappie. This movie gets a 1 for only one good action scene
10	Neill Blomkamps masterpiece chappie is really creative. I liked this more than district 9, but district 9 was still good. Chappie is now my favourite character.
0	One of the worst movies I have seen in my whole life. Flat (aka no) story. Bad pacing. Sloppy camera work. Horrible acting. Internal incoherence. Lousy fight choreography. Mediocre FX. The "technical" side is spitting into the face of every real developer on this planet. What a waste of time. And it just wouldn't end...
6	Chappie isn't a technically good movie but it is an enjoyable movie. honestly i thought it had it's good moments and had some really cleaver themes but it doesn't make the most of them. hugh jackman is a villain that need more time devoted for backstory and Chappie should have spent more time with Dev Patel's character but instead we stuck with the gangster who are the worst part of the film. it had some cool action and i thought Sharlto Copley was great as Chappie and it is an entertaining movie it just could have been better and i'll think it will pale into insignificance when compared wit Ex-Machina and Time Of Eve
7	I do not understand the reviews for this movie. There were a few clangers and plotholes, but underneath a good, earnest, positive, interesting and engaging movie. Much better than you've been told.
8	Yes, this movie has a huge plot holes. Yes, it's AI and consciousness approach is rather unscientific. But this movie is as much ALIVE as Chappie himself - sometimes naive, sometimes stupid, I don't know how to describe it.. it has a genuine SOUL. And, as we can see in majority of reviews, this soul resonates with people's cultural and genetic notions of parental love, redemption and hope. That's why we give such a high scores despite primitive and aggressive methods of delivering those emotions.
10	I don't get what all of the negative press is one about this movie is up there for one for my favorite movies this year. I the AI is pretty accurate and Blompkamp still makes the most realistic robot vs human fights ever!
9	What do all the haters want from this movie.?This is basically an adult version of short Circuit... With an awesome central performance from sharlto copley. .. That is both humerous and touching.
0	The WORST Movie I Have EVER seen in my LIFE (And Believe me I've seen a lot).. EVERYTHING IS WRONG in this movie, from the story (there's no plot),to the locations,the lack of any sense of logic, to the Casting OMG this is the worst ,it's full of unknown zero talented unworthy of being called "Actors", and with characters Names like "Ninja" ,"Yo-Landi","Amerika","Pitbull"... (btw "Ninja" ,"Yo-Landi" are also their Real names). The Casting was extremely horrific, I've never seen acting so bad ,even barney the dinosaur had better acting skills, you never connect to any of the characters, no actor fits the role and with the extremely poorly written story and dialog they can't offer much. You shouldn't expect much from the Director/writer who prevously created Elysium "which is very bad but at least had great potentials if written the right way and is Marginly better than this one" . You might be tricked into watching this movie because it's a Hugh Jackman Movie (like I did), but this movie is Jackman's worst performance, worst look, worst accent and worst character. Robots (droids) have always been cool, but Not in this movie, here they are the most stupid most boring, most annoying thing , as I watched a robot act like a child for the whole movie , and it believed simple lies while at the same time they're trying to convince us it has true A.I superior to Humans's . Finally, I want to say that I'm actually a big fan of Hugh Jackman and consider him one of the best actors of current time and I'm surprised and saddened he accepted this movie.
10	Chappie is such a great movie. Shame the critics don't like it. IGN gave it like a 75 which I thought for them was way low. I'm into the sci-fi stuff so if ur not u may not like it I'll say that about it. Although its not a homerun for everyone, The ones who do like movies like pacific rim and district 9 this movie is a 10. Go see it don't believe the hate. Its def a ride worth taking.
4	Chappie: "I've got blings?... I've got blings!". That's the kind of dialogue you get from this movie and I was actually forward to this until I sawed. The story is about a near future, crime is patrolled by an oppressive mechanized police force. But now, the people are fighting back. When one police droid, Chappie, is stolen and given new programming, he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. As powerful, destructive forces start to see Chappie as a danger to mankind and order, they will stop at nothing to maintain the status quo and ensure that Chappie is the last of his kind. I remembered watching the first trailer for Chappie and being so moved and so interested in the idea of a Short Circuit mash with a little violent future with the street gangs and people just being A-holes to each other. I got pumped for the movie and Neill Blomkamp hasn't disappointed me yet and some people may dislike Elysium but to me I enjoyed that film and I really enjoyed District 9, I mean it was such a original, new and today's Sci-Fi classic. So why on earth wouldn't I not be looking forward to this movie. After seeing the movie, you know what else hurts more than pain? Disappointment. Let's first start of with the positive things in this movie: Sharlto Copley did a fantastic job playing Chappie and he also did great doing the Motion capture. Copley really brought life to his character and it was a good choice to do. Dev Patel was also good as well, his character was the only likable human being in the whole movie, so was Chappie before he turns into a little **** later on. The visual effect's was good as well. What Neill Blomkamp dose well in his movies is blend in effect's and story together smoothly and well done. The action scenes were shot very well and the sound mixing & editing were really good. Now for the bad and there's a lot: The two band members in this movie Ninja and Yo-Landi Visser who are known as Die Antwoord for they band name, well the acting from those two was not very good...it was god awful bad. These two really can't act and I heard that they never had acting lesson's before and this is basically they first time in a movie acting and it shows really well. They character's in the movie have to be the most annoying, unlikable and scum of the earth A-holes that I wanted to die because they were bad people doing bad things. Later on in the movie Chappie himself turns into a big dick to everyone. He throws grenades at people and steals people cars. Are main hero everyone, when his not treating or hurting people he goes around talking gangster in that annoying voice of his and at's rude to everyone around. Chappie the **** robot. Hugh Jackman as the villain is the stick in the mood bland villain that his plains don't work or don't really make any sense at all. Sigourney Weaver only has a couple of scenes in this movie and her character doesn't really do anything special or anything worth talking about. I love Han Zimmer music in every movie his a part of and in this movie his music once again was great to listen to, but that quickly stopped as the music changed into Die Antwoord music and I know some people out there are fans of they music but I'm not. This has to be the worst and the most annoying peace of music I ever heard, it was trash music and I hated it. Listen, you had no idea how much I wanted this to be good, actually I wanted this to be amazing, but I was extremely disappointed and kind of upset that this turned out bad. The movie could have Neill Blomkamp second best film and it could broken new grounds with it's story and message that's true to life, but no, you know what we got? Annoying human characters that I couldn't give a damn if they die or not, and the movie itself was a big giant mess, I'm pretty shocked how messy this film is. I'm sorry everyone but this movie was awful.
9	I can't understand the mixed reviews from the professional critics? This film is very, very good and very much worth your time. Chappie explores; what it means to be human and consciousness, our emotional complexities and behaviours, crime and law enforcement and our ever growing dependence on technology. A lot like Neill Blomkamp's other two films it has a great focus on poverty. This film is trademark Blomkamp, who is very much becoming a filmmaking auteur. If you like District 9 then you'll love Chappie. The robotics in Elysium were no doubt the most intriguing aspect of the film and they have explore them further in this film. Chappie is a thrilling and emotional joyride and excellently made. Superb science fiction.
2	Really bad movie. Did not like it at all. Story did not make sense. Not a well done movie. Would not see it unless you like action and killing. Did not like how they made Johannesburg seem like such a horrible place and was a war zone. And why did the Maker not fight more for his Robot he made. And just left Chappie there with people who were not good influences and bad people. So dumb! But that is just my opinion.
3	Unfortunately, only a weak film. Chappie saw in the trailers so good. But since you only saw the best scenes. But it's not all schhlecht. The social message is well chosen and the film is technically excellent. Unfortunately, the story is at times so stupid and illogical that one can only shake my head. Who the quality of District 9 is expected very disappointed. Hollywood has influenced his films too negative. The famous two actors (Jackman and Weaver) remain totally pale.
8	Let's face it. The critics are often wrong. I read reviews before I saw this film and it was like they were talking about a different movie. Frankly, they just didn't get it. There's some shoot 'em up stuff, of course but at it's heart Chappie is a story about family. Dysfunctional but caring. There's comedy and pathos and a really interesting twist on the "what is consciousness, what is human" theme. It's a freaking character study of Chappie and his found family.
8	After viewing the reviews for this movie I made an account to provide a more proper review. I am an avid movie viewer and watch several new movies a week. In the past 24 hours I ave watched American Sniper and Chappie in theaters. I didn't want to watch American Sniper because I assumed it was a movie made for rednecks, but after the slow beginning it was amazing and had me in tears, but that's for another review. My expectations for Chappie were not high. I listen to Die Antwoord and I was prepared to cringe at their acting and the overused plot. In brief, the movie was stupid and neat. Stupid neat. I enjoyed it. The target audience for this film are R&B lovers, gangsters by heart, nerds, cultured people that can put oddness aside, and people with an interest in technology. I can understand the mixed reviews because not a lot of people fit into these categories, and I would not recommend the film to these people. I fell under the near market, and the previous exposure to Die Antwoord market. This film is not going to win most original, best picture, or acting but as for a movie to go watch with a friend on a Saturday night, I give it an B+ or an A-. It exercised the mind and your inner gangster. After the movie I had pulled up Die Antwoord on Spotifiy and drove to their South African R&B beats and it was fun. There were plenty of cliches that are associated with this type of film, but among the recylced plot was its own touch of creativity. Their were vivid colors, not too much focus on stupid violence, and things that you won't see in any other AI film. There were plenty of silly plot wholes that act as conversation starters after the film, such as security protocol. So I would call this a social film. Go watch it with a friend that fits the markets.
8	Another excellent movie in Blomkamps signature style of movies like District 9. Chappie is excellently crafted and you really do care about him. The CGI is second to none, the robot designs are incredibly detailed and looked so believable you couldn't tell it apart from the real thing. The story is pretty good if a little bit tropey, but it gets the message across. Better than Elysium, but not quite as good as District 9. Great movie, highly recommend it.
10	We came out of the movie raving about it. There are plenty of other movies out there already that have tackled the subject of AI, consciousness, etc, but: this one did it much, much better. I'm surprised to see such negative reviews, but the best parts of the movie were subtle. This is a movie where paying attention is rewarded immensely, whether it comes to Chappie's animations or the small moments that affect Chappie's character development. I laughed hard, I teared up, I came away satisfied.
10	CHAPPiE does alot of good doings in his role. He is having an issue with his life, and completly, he felt sorry, & wanted to have this... mystical kinda s--t. The movie was amazing. I was hopping for another one... But, I know that won't happend, since The director & Sharlto Copley given a 41 by Metacritic :(
10	What an inventive story! If only there wasn't so much r-rated stuff, this would be great for young boys, maybe young girls. In less than two hours, we watch a consciousness grow and learn. It was cute, but also thought provoking. Some minds grow up to be honorable, other minds have no interest in honor. Because of that, the idea of A.I. Is scary and this movie shows why.
3	A better movie to watch if it was muted. Awesome visuals... AWEFUL story telling. 90% of this movie was watching chappie grow up to be a degenerate gangster. The only satisfying part of this movie was the last 20 minutes with the exception of opening it up for a sequel.
6	This movie's been rattling around my head since I saw it a few days ago, something I can't say for most movies of its ilk. While I can't bring myself to say it's that good, in fact in some ways it's pretty terrible, it certainly is compelling. What really struck me most was how Die Antwoord simply hijacked the movie, and I say that with a sense of admiration rather than criticism. Their asthetic, their music, their t-shirts for crying out loud are all over this joint. Really, the movie's about them and the robot is a side story. For most of Americans who have barely heard of them (if at all) this movie will likely seem to come straight out of left field as we lack the context to understand them or where they're coming from. Their style is certainly unique, and odd, and the two of them seem more alien than the robot. Grafted onto Die Antwoord's expression of "zef" culture is a fairly tired, 2 dimensional meditation on artificial intelligence and what makes us human. Not as strong as either of Blomkamp's previous two films. Hugh Jackman's character is particularly cardboard, and Dev Patel's even more so. Still, worth seeing just for Ninja and Yolindi's hijinks, plus the setting is evocative as usual for a Blomkamp film.
7	Went in to Chappie thinking it would go one way and it ended up going a completely different direction. That's not necessarily a bad thing. I enjoyed this movie a lot and fell in love with Chappie. Thematically, it is a very strong movie. It touches on struggles with mortality and the balance of good and bad just to name a couple. The science fiction in this movie is very interesting. My only gripe was that some of the characters in the movie were very abrasive and tough to deal with. Ninja especially. The movie tends to bounce around a lot and leaves minor plot questions. Well worth seeing though. I have yet to be disappointed by Neill Blomkamp.
7	Same or a bit better than Elysium, worse than District 9. Another great performance by Sharlto Copley. Great visuals. Lots of funny moments. Hugh Jackman is pretty good. But the movie was just pretty good. The ending is WAY TOO LONG. It also seems that most of the bad stuff that happens during the climax is fixed in the end. Kind of takes you out of the experience. Nothing too original. Not as bad as the critics say. But just as good from the director that brought us one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the past 10 years. Shame he cannot reach that height again. Hope he does better next time. Maybe it is not Blomkamp's fault. But it is a shame seeing pretty good movies after a fantastic one.
9	Chappie is a clever story line that rides the fringes of current futurist discussions on AI yet keeping a compelling story. Great acting, culturally unique, great CGI and thrills me to no end the public and professional critics have such a diverse rating, disruption for the win, black swan if you will. The people have spoken. Chappie keep that swag up.
5	Was expecting more of a Short Circuit type screenplay. Was very disappointed overall with the acting & dialogue. Kids might like it more but overall this is another overrated movie on this site by others
8	way better then expected. im a fan of blomkamps movies I have to admit. they are somewhat formulaic but it kind of always works because its an actual original idea. yeah Elysium was kinda weak, but it was better then most of the garbage that's being pumped out these days. I was excited to see this since the 1st trailer I saw. marketing was solid as it wasn't constant bombardment of ads showing only the cool stuff. so its always surprising how the story unfolds, but then the critics, my god, the critics hammered this movie. I almost didn't want to see it. but it was perfect because when I eventually did see it my expectations were considerably lowered, and I was pleasantly surprised with a solid sci-fi future action flick. critics all said it was really blomkamp-y being filmed in s. Africa-again, but it actually wasn't as bad as elysm, which looked like they used the D9 set. it was gritty but it only added to the whole futuristic dystopian blah, blah, blah. having unknown actors was cool, I guess theyre actually famous for something, but ive never heard of them so it works out perfectly. s.african/English accent is brutal to listen to, but you get used to it as the movie goes on and begin to understand what theyre saying, chappie as a kid and learning was a dope idea for the movie, but the plot holes that came along with that story were the only downside to the movie. but chappie's development and personality were great. the critics made him out to be jar jar binx or something, but really was not that bad. silly in some parts but not outright annoying. the bad guy was basically the same bad guy as in D9, elysm. I mean really the same-exact-character. but aside from that I didn't see the whole Robocop comparison, I mean yeah the robots did look similar, but different story. overall there were a lot of plot holes, but it was a good action movie. decent special effects, great story but a few too many stretches in the story were this movies downfall. its worth a watch.
1	Watching this movie, it is clear that the majority of the budget went into animating the robots, much to the detriment of Everything Else. This extends so far that the director had to take footage from the South African Special Task Force documentary and use a wireless mouse USB receiver as the main plot MacGuffin. Summary: Cliche plot strung along by nonsensical and unsympathetic characters, poor sound effects, thoroughly lazy acting and prop design. Primary purpose appears to have been done to fulfill contractual obligations for Sony product placement instead of movie watcher. 1/10 would not recommend.
10	I loved Chappie. But then again, I am a scifi robot and AI movie fan. A lot of critics gave static for this movie. I guess they weren't scifi fans. Character arch is rushed but solid. Still considering the moral dilemma what is worse, kill someone's maternal figure or drive a pacifist to hurt someone.
9	Chappie is an action packed movie that in certian instances had me wondering about things that seemed kinda weird but cool. Chappie's action is never ending in this movie and the CGI is incredibly impressive. The story is interesting but questionable at certain times. The one thing i HATE about this movie is Sony's self-advertising in the movie. around 10 PS4's are shown, all/most computers are their brand and it felt more like a movie where in every instance possible they almost always use their products. That aside, the movie feels like something from the not to distance future of robotics. The one questionable role was Hugh Jackman, felt like he was mad for no reason. Yeah is own model of a robot wasn't asked to be used but it was just stupid and slow! Personal opinion: Chappie is an incredible movie and kudos to sony on the CGI, action packed movie with a good story line! but Sony's self advertising made you remember it was a movie. Some instances of the movie felt fake and made you feel like either saying 'WHAT!?' or 'THIS IS SOOOOO COOL!!!. I'm part of the later 9 out of 10
9	Great film, I am confused as to why some critics give such negative reviews, but I liked it a lot. I It is rare to see sci-fi movies that are as touching as Chappie. I really hope it gets the success it deserves.
3	A mess with boring characters, some terrible actors, a lot of horrendous action scenes and inconsistencies, makes the film to be really forgettable. What happened to you Neil?
10	No other movie in years has entertained me, moved me and made me laugh like Chappie did. This movie really spoke to me. It's definitely not your typical robots, action and explosions movie, like I first suspected based on the trailer, which sucked. It has some great action, effects and cool music, but that's definitely not all it has to offer. First time in my life I'm going to see the same movie twice in cinema. It's a good movie, no bullsh*t, so do yourself a favor and go see it right now, I'm not lying, it's even better than District 9 and Elysium! 10/10 :)
8	Chappie was a cute movie that doesnt do anything new, but doesnt do anything really wrong either. The plot wasnt an A to B tale, which is why people are complianing it has no plot. chappie was cute and the was quite a bit of tounge in cheek humor. It doesnt deserve any awards but it was still a good way to spend a couple of hours.
9	"Chappie" is isn't exactly the best cinematic experience for average movie goer, we can agree that this film isn't perfect artwork . But it looks good and a watchable piece of fine art. Director/co-writer Neil Blomkamp and other writer Terri Tatchell, keep trying to focus on three or four stories, to make a film but an order to make good-looking film you have to focus on one story. Not even the actors Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, and Dev Patel can save this film from a script were we have Chappie. Die antwoord the band stars as the lead characters as gangsters, it's confusing on how they star in it but they don't play them selves? their music is bad and we don't buy their acting. Sharlto Copley's motion capture performance is astonishing and that's what sold the movie "priceless," this could of been an A movie but it's a B+ movie. Since Blomkamp ("District 9 and "Elysium"), is taking over the "Alien 5" franchise i think we should worry? or i could not have been more concerned? will he make his A.I robots fight with the aliens? confusing. Grade B+
9	I've come to understand if "professional critics" don't like a movie usually us common folk consumers do. This movie does a great job of not taking it self too seriously with drawn out plot points and extreme overacting. It keeps a fast pace with a healthy mix of comedy, drama, and action. This movie reminded me that going to the movies should be fun. Ninja and Yolandi were clearly given some creative control over the scenes they were in. Critics may not appreciate their unique approach to the arts, but these two managed to take the creative uniqueness from their music and inject it into acting. It creates a unique atmosphere that really made this movie shine. This movie wont be winning any awards for drama or action. No, this movie succeeds in a more important aspect. It's entertaining which is something a lot of movies lately have failed at. So grab yourself some popcorn and a drink and have fun.
8	I really enjoyed this movie! The pacing at the beginning felt a little too fast or not quite right, but it really found its legs about 1/4 of the way through and picked up its game. The graphics were some of the best I've seen - absolutely flawless. Really interesting ideas too! A few floors in the plot, but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this. Bring on the next Blomkamp movie!
10	SCREW the critics. Seriously, this movie was great. The interactions between Chappie and Die Antwoord alone are reason enough to love this movie. Ninja wants desperately for Chappie to be a gangster so he can help him with heists, but Chappie's mind is that of a child. But Chappie starts to see them as parents and wants to make them proud. This movie is funny and endearing, but at times hard to watch. It kept me on my toes the whole time, but mostly because I thought I had a general idea of how it was going to end (which the actual ending surprised me). I don't know what these critics were smoking with these reviews, but I'm usually a stickler with my movies but found this one to be great! I would recommend it to any fan of the genre.
4	With is third sci fi outing Neil Blomkamp turns his attention to AI. In a world where robot policemen are the norm, Dev Patel has created the worlds first robot with the ability to think for itself. For some reason his superiors aren't interested (why??) and before he can fine tune his creation it is stolen by a gang and is taught to act gangsta! Visually the film is excellent, where it falls down is in the script, storytelling and the acting. Plot holes abound, the security company at the heart of the story looks more like Wrexham Hogg from The Office, with security measures to match, and the acting of punk pair Die Antwood (in two lead roles) is truly appalling. Lets hope for his future films Blomkamp employs a script writer and story editor so that the rest of his films can match up to his stunning visuals.
10	I will have to stand up for a movie that is so unique, that most critics will not understand it. Critics of these genres never expect change. This movie breaks the boundaries of how we see AI and human development. Not just, comedy, current affairs and moral values are portrayed in this movie. It deals with existentialism in totally different way. Maybe this movie is too hard for the average mind to understand, but if you are truly intelligent and also have knowledge about South African culture, you will understand that this movie is more than brilliant. You require insight to truly watch this movie. Prejudice will only cripple your mind. This movie is what is to be human. So simple as that.
10	THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING ! i have nothing to complain about this movie either that the fact that the bad guys/good guys who want Chappie to be bad are played by a freacking music band ! what the **** !?
9	If you just sit and relax, you can enjoy a GREAT sci-fi movie that is full of heart! Yes, it has it's flaws, but they are those little things that you can simply forget if you just focus on enjoying the movie. In overall, I give it a 9/10. It has humour, heart and great action. What more can you ask?
8	This was a great movie. I couldn't help but laugh and 'awww' at Chappies dialogue. It is well worth the watch. It's a combination of the vulgarity and technology of District 9 and the charm and humor of Wall-e.
10	Finally a clever, thoughtful movie about artificial intelligence and robots. Finally a movie that doesn't judge robots as a "thing" in itself, but show how AI and robots are just what we humans make them.
5	Chappies mildly entertaining, at times it's funny as it features a foul mouthed robot but essentially it's unoriginal. The film feels like Elysium all over again and some of the robots are stolen right out of robocop (the moose). I wish the acting had been better but essentially the main characters that should have carried the film for pop stars with little acting ability
8	(spoilers ahead) So I'm a pretty big fan of these critical thinking movies, and there's a lot of thinking and philosophy to be gained from this movie and the movie does a great job with the whole theme of god, humanity, immortality, and loss of innocence as we watch our main character Chappie come to terms with the world. But here's the thing that personally got me and that's the ending, it wasn't terrible but int the whole build up of Chappie essentially dying and with this looming death overhead he tries to find other means to try and live even breaking his promise with Dion saying he will do no crime so there's the loss of innocence as he ignores Dion and get's tempted by everyone else to do commit crime, and in the end it should of been a confrontation with him and Dion (his maker) who is kinda portraying god who at the end of the movie is dying from a fight but Chappie believes he can save him by transferring his consciousness into another robot essentially letting him live forever, but this is successful and Chappie does come to terms with his death happy to sacrifice himself so that his maker is alive and well but Dion then say he can save Chappie too and this is successful. I am saying that a sadder ending would of been miles better in delivering a message about humanity and all but in the end the overall movie is visually stunning with his robotics and does provide a look on someone growing up and facing hardships making him stronger for it (even though the movie is being held within the spam of a week). I was actually sort of thinking the story would of been different like the police were abusing their power and a guy who made the robots get's another point of view and decides to help by trying to create a robot that will help rise against the oppressors and this goes with the theme of Chappie growing up and is being pulled by two sides as both argue a somewhat valid point like one guy suggest going against the robots and that'll take the power for the corrupted another suggest go for the head of the snake and kill the corrupted so they can instead have the power.
10	The Best Movie Of 2015 Chappie Ofers Great Acting Intense Drama And Exiting Battles And Story All The Charecters Are Perflectly Acted The Only Thing I Slightly Dont Like Is The Ending It Just Is Sudden And We Dont Get To Know What Happend To Chappie His Creator The Bad Guy The Robotics Company Nor Any Of The Characters And It Seems To Be Itching For A Sequel
5	Chappie was an okay movie, but not great. It was certainly entertaining and had moments that made me smile and chuckle, but otherwise it didn't really bring anything else to the table. I like Die Antwoord, and they were actually pretty good in the movie but I found their shameless self- promotion in every scene quite jarring (Yolandi and "Ninja" play the same roles as they do in their band, listen to their own music, wear their own T-Shirts, etc). Some have mentioned this movie is some kind of tribute to them, but I don't see how. There was some wasted star power from Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman, though I will say that Sharlto Copley's performance as Chappie was quite excellent. Tonality wise, it felt like this movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. The Robocop meets Short Circuit vibe was *very* on the nose, and sadly the two concepts blended together like oil and water. In fact, it could have easily been a great family movie if it weren't for the swearing, nudity, and gore (all of which contributed nothing to the overall experience). As a result the whole thing felt like a dumbed down B-movie with really good effects (which isn't bad if that's what you had intended to watch). Lastly, this movie's theme was lost on me. Perhaps there wasn't one. It certainly lacked what District 9 and Elysium had, so don't expect any thoughtful commentary about Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, or South African street crime.
10	This film is one of the greatest in the history of Cinema...Why? because it's a great story, great actors, great special effects, great sense of humor, great emotions, great feelings, everything is great about this movie, you will love the robot, the director, and Die Antwoord, maybe you can hate hugh jackman, but you can't hate this movie, even if you don't like this kind of sci/fi movies you can really enjoy it. I really don't know why this movie is not on many cinemas or why it has received bad reviews from sites like metacritic, imdb, or rotten tomatoes, everyone should see this movie, it's better than gravity or birdman or any other oscar winning movie.
8	The reviewers totally misunderstood this film. It's not about Artificial Intelligence, Die Antwood, Robocop or South Africa. This is the quintessential 'outsider' film. Everyone character is alone, from Sigourney Weaver to Hugh Jackman. Even the gang members aren't united. Blomkamp hands it to us on a platter with the 'Black Sheep' story but the critics overlooked it. It's a film about trying to find your identity. It's about bullies. Its about how cruel and selfish people can be. 'You all lie!' A couple of plot holes, yes, but hopefully, in time, this film will find it's way into acceptance. A shame for all involved as there's much to discover, not all so obvious.
0	I have only one word to say. D.A.R.Y.L. Remember that one? If you're old enough, you will, and you'll know that this is not exactly the most original plot out there.
7	Neil blomkamp's most recent movie Chappie is a good movie, but a flawed one, and a bit of a disappointment from the director, as District 9 became a Sci-Fi classic. What I loved in the movie was Chappie himself, he is the cutest in-human movie protagonist since E.T, and some of the best pats of the movie revolved around Chappie growing up, and I loved it. I also liked how Chappie represents Children living in places like South Africa or Rio, who, while pure at heart, are corrupted by money and the criminal lifestyle. However, there were many things I didn't like about the movie. I didn't like the gangsters who took Chappie away from his owner. I realize they are part of a south African rap group, but you never grow to love ther. their mean people who do despicable things to chappie, and while the movie tries to make you feel sorry for them, I never rooted for them through the whole movie. Other than that, i just think the plot and the scripting were little off, but i still enjoyed the movie. I would recommend this movie to any Sci-Fi fan, and even though its a bit underwhelming coming from Blomkamp, i'm still excited that he's directing the next Alien's movie.
6	It's not 'District 9' (in any way) and maybe bumps into a lot of sentimental and action-genre clichÃ©s, but "Chappie" is an undeniably entertaining and funny fable. Oh, and Hugh Jackman(!) is in it, too.
10	Best unintentionally hilariously brilliant movie of the year! Me and my friends had some time to kill so we decided to see a random movie that's we'd never heard of, it'd likely be bad but it'd be a good laugh. We were SO! happy we picked this one.
10	Truly beautiful movie about what makes us human. I enjoyed it a lot and I can't understand why Chappie wasn't more succesful. The action sequences were also pretty thrilling. I do like the actors too, although everyone seems to dislike them. Interesting lead roles who play their parts very convincing. I love it ! 10 out of 10.
4	Neill Blomkamp delivers an interesting premise like the one who defined Elysium and District 9, but its like this one took all of its concentration in Chappie's character and forgot about the rest, leaving a disappointing sci-fi flick who could have being marvelous.
7	Chappie is a science fiction film directed by Neill Blomkamp (director of District 9 and Elysium) and stars Sharlto Copley and Dev Patel. The premise of Chappie is very intriguing, a guy decides to build a sophisticated A.I. that can think and feel. This movie, however, takes an interesting turn. Instead of becoming this sweet and lovable robot, he becomes an a****** and a gangster and completely ignore's Deon (Dev Patel) while committing various crimes. But, the movie does do a great job of how showing how a child's mind is so easily influenced. However, there are some major issues with this movie. First of all, the actors who played the gangsters who raise Chappie (voiced by Sharlto Copley) are completely terrible at acting. I mean, like Razzie worthy. None of the lines they say have any emotional depth and they can be extremely over-the-top and annoying as hell. The other big issue is the pacing, which is a complete mess. Some parts feel slow and some parts feel fast-paced. But all-in-all, Chappie is a good and thought provoking science-ficton film that conveys how the mind of a child can be so easily bended. 7/10
5	One of those movies that can get incredibly right some parts, a perfect 10, and screws so badly other themes and scenes that make you cringe in disbelief, "wtf have I watched?". My score could not be other than 5.The movie has Blomkamp signature: fast yet clever, good characters with enough development, that forces you to ride with the movie to get the whole scenario, and this was incredibly awesome. I think this was the first movie this year i cared about the characters, "good and evil", if there are any. But at the same time it gets so cheesy and vain that you can't believe it's the same movie.
1	Random thoughts: Why do the robots have to sound like **** 1960's sci-fi movies? Even google's voice to speech sounds waay better. I thought this was supposed to be like the future or something. Consciousness.dat stable?? Why the crappy actors?
4	Although Chappie improved toward the end, the movie is very amateurish. Chappie is like a film student's final year project. Employing rappers to act in the film didn't help. The first 10 min were District 9.5. Many of the plot elements had question marks, like the guy could create artificial intelligence but couldn't program it to understand English immediately? Overall, Chappie is crappy.
6	hmm I have very mixed feelings about this one... The beginning got me hooked... The progression after with chappie growing with the gang was not what I was expecting and kinda brought the value of the movie down in my eyes. Some point between the middle and the end got a little interesting but certain parts towards the end (especially the big fight scenes) made the movie seem corny and poorly thought out. The concept is a really good one. I know because that was what got me hooked on seeing the movie. However, the execution left a lot to be desired. Overall, a decent film with so much unrealized potential. 6/10
8	There's something here for everyone, except stuck up film snobs apparently. It's a fun movie, just adjust your expectations. Far more human and interesting than Ex Machina
9	Very good fun to watch. Chappie is a generally loveable film with an interesting plot, good characters and even though Die Antwoord don't act, they did it pretty well. Recommended to watch.
6	The underlying elements of any traditional black sheep story are thought provoking and moving. Not every piece of science-fiction strikes with such emotion - but when it does, it's worth it. Chappie does it well - and we have fun along the way.
5	I movie with great potential and an amazing story sadly tainted by being turned into a 2 hour long advert for the rap group Die Antwoord, whose music is used constantly in the movie - only serving to kill the mood and generally just p**s me off. The final straw was seeing one of the main characters standing with a shirt of the rap group's name, and the camera being zoomed in on it. It's like product placement, and really ruined the movie.
7	Awesome movie was a bit of a letdown from Elysium. I was surprised how many people were in my theater when it was over halfway empty. The robot was very funny and I actually had feelings for the gang members.
10	Guys, Movie is EPIC. I don't know what's wrong with the critics (probably they weren't be paid at all). But this is MUST SEE type of movie. Action, Story, Acting, Picture, Music, everything is there. I'm really said seeing movie like that are ranked so badly.
10	the negative reviews and critics are morons. this movie got better as it progressed. great acting and chappies personality was great and there were many funny moments. this movie was very well done and the cgi was spot on. one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.
6	Have you seen Short Circuit? Did you wish it had more gang violence, carjackings, and gratuitous gore? Chappie is a mostly enjoyable, somewhat cartoonish, surprisingly derivative effort from a director whose last two films were undeniably original. But just because something's been done before doesn't mean it can't be done again, and have fun doing it, taking some interesting (and one very ridiculous) turns along the way. The visual effects are great, particularly the rendering of the title character. The acting is also quite good, including a couple of entertaining performances by rappers Ninja and Yolandi Visser (and her pet rat) of Die Antwoord, playing fictionalized versions of themselves.
1	I was very, very disappointed in Chappie. It has made me question if Blomkamp is the exciting talent I thought he was after District 9. Every element of this film except the effects seems poor and dated. The acting is diabolical and the dialogue is even worse. Chappie is essentially a robotic Jar Jar Binks and I couldn't force myself to be sympathetic and stop hating him. Such a waste.
10	This was great. I don't usually laugh at the endless forced jokes in America/British/Canadian movies but this had me cracking up. Think of this as Sci-Fi Comedy, the trailers don't really do it justice and you go in expecting grim misery.
10	I had high expectations from this movie, since I absolutely love District 9 (same director in case you didn't know) and thought Elysium was very decent as well, but... Chappie exceeded my expectations by far. Such a fantastic film.
4	Chappie is a film of poor execution. Never in a movie have at times I cared for the a character and hated them so much. The inconsistency of the robot Chappie is simply unbelievable considering its the centerpiece of the movie. Some scenes are done well while others are atrocious. Same goes for the music, the characters, and tone. Its just a film filled with inconsistencies from start to finish.
9	Blomkamp did it again, wow what a movie. Enjoyed it immensely and so did my friends. It is as touching as it funny and believable, can't believe how I didn't watch it in theaters just because of low critics score, well that's a lesson I learned, critics have a weird taste in a movies, so from now on their opinion is to be avoided. Watch it and you won't regret it
3	What a load of garbage! "Chappie", like most Neill Blomkamp's offers, is visually striking and boasts a well-chosen cast, but unlike Neill's other movies, "Chappie" is hampered by unlikable, underdeveloped secondary characters, heavy-handed narrative elements and a familiar message. It's depressing and manipulative in some sense. I apologize to those who liked it, but I couldn't stand it. 3/10.
5	After seeing Chappie I am a lot less excited about Neill Blomkamp (District 9) taking over the Alien franchise. It's about criminals who steal and teach a special police droid how to be gangster. So he can help them with a heist. While Chappie's creator (Dev Patel) tries to reach out to teach him right and wrong. Hugh Jackman plays a former soldier who would rather humans be the law over robots. So he especially has a problem with Chappie having a mind of his own and thinking he is human Johnny 5 style. Except Johnny 5 was more likeable. Chappie himself is a lot like the movie; unintentionally laughable and kind of annoying.
10	es una gran pelÃ­cula la cual te mantiene muy entretenido en todo momento por la gran actuaciÃ³n de chappie y la creatividad de poder inventar un software para darle sentimientos humanos a un robot por eso se merece un 10 esta pelicula
7	I did not have high expectations for Chappie when I tuned in. Neil Blomkamp didn't impress me with Elysium and I had heard similar things about Chappie. I enjoyed watching Chappie develop as a character throughout the movie and its hard not to be interested in him as such an innocent form of artificial intelligence. I thought there were some pretty good performances in here. Dev Patel is pretty good and its pretty hard to criticise Hugh Jackman either, its a nice change to see him as the villain. Still Sigourney Weaver was very underused and Ninja the South African rapper hogged a lot of the screen time acting like an idiot and trying to promote his band Die Antwood. I found Ninja incredibly annoying at points and I hope we don't see him again in any major role. Other than that I enjoyed the action that Chappie had to offer and I think that if you are a fan of Blomkamp's other films you will likely enjoy this one.
4	I expected SO MUCH MORE from this movie, and just didn't get it. Everyone who had read the book was talking up the intellectual inquiry of the subject matter, the interesting characters and the like. The film was nothing more than a special effects showcase, and not a terribly good one, IMHO. VERY forgettable stuff.
9	Sure, if you don't believe in Santa Claus, send the presents back. But please don't complain once you've opened them. People who don't want this film won't get it. But I can't speak to that because I can't imagine NOT liking this movie. Yes, the book is more thoughtful, but all these years and two sequels later the movie is still an awesome fantasy.
10	One of the grandest entertainments ever. If Spielberg's prior(and more personal)blockbuster films suffered from an overly zealous sentimentality(ET) or quasi-religious pretensions(Close Encounters), Jurassic Park, directed by a maturer artist, found the perfect balance between themepark thrills and somber reflection. It was and still is a rare thing, a movie that not only uses special effects for thrills but to dazzle and awe. In this regard, it's comparable to 2001 which, almost alone among space movies, conveyed a sense of immensity of the cosmos instead of turning it into a football field for spaceships. Jurassic Park was, of course, a summer blockbuster and brimming over with rollercoaster visuals but it's undeniably much more. It creates a world beyond our imagination, dazzles our senses as much as it chills our spines. Oddly enough, Spielberg also directed Schindler's List in the same year, with JP being about man trying to revive an extinct species and SL being about man trying to drive a race toward extinction; both within the confines of a secluded, laboratory like setting. While it may seem perverse to compare a summer blockbuster with a truly harrowing Holocaust movie, it would be foolish to deny JP grapples with some of the grandest of issues, what with the recent advancements in genetic technology; namely, that the world is bigger than science or ideology, and it would be a case of hubris to think otherwise.
10	The best popcorn film of the nineties. It is thrilling, presenting exhilarating action scenes. Spielberg is a visionary: Jurassic Park is pure movie magic. It is no surprise, though, that movie critics don't take it seriously. Movies like these are not made for them.
3	What is this? One of the greatest special effects tour de forces in movie history, but populated by B acting performances and a plot so uninspired that Spielberg doesn't care whether you notice or not, so long as yurassis parked for the show.
10	This is just an excellent movie. Thats all I have to say.
10	Pat c., first off it was BOOK before a movie so don't yell at spielberg for the awesome plot, and second, this is one of the best movies ever.
8	Jurassic Park is an incredibly effective film - a fact received not without astonishment, considering the weak elements it intermittently displays! For the purist, I am sure, JP is heavily laden with gaping 'logic-holes' and more than a couple of unexplained plot irregularities. But none of this really matters... Put succinctly, this is one hell of an action-thriller. A fantastic story filled with mind-blowing effects and generally credible characters. On a sidenote, I just don't know how so many kids sat through this film...I am well into adulthood (not necessarily maturity) but when T.Rex first attacked I might as well have been five again...I s..t myself! This is a great adventure film with plenty of thrills and chills - and just the right dosage of comedic relief, especially from the brilliant Jeff Goldblum. It has its share of faults, no doubt - but rarely have weaknesses been so negligible. A must see.
7	Good movie, but the most annoy children imaginable on the silver screen knock it down a couple of notches.
3	Before seeing it for the first time, you want to believe the hype. Then, you've seen it, and it ends up feeling more like an awkward social engagement that exhausts and discourages. A film that should instill great hope in its audience fails every time it tries too hard to please and not to push our buttons. For a real thrill, see Shyamalan's dread-inducing thrillfest "Signs."
10	Absolutely wonderful as the dinosaurs came to life. Fantastic job by all.
10	An excellent movie. The CGI combines with the well-planned action is thrilling and exciting!
10	Simply wonderful. Mr. Spielberg made me believe that dinosaurs still walked the Earth. This is a must see film with chills and thrills galore.
9	I have a special bond with his movie. Jurassic park was the first movie i ever saw in a Theater, and what a way to start off! Good CGI, but the characters have Hollywood entertainment flowing through them, adding energy to what would've been a by-the-numbers flick. Good editing, too. The sequels aren't outright bad, kinda like ID4 with dinos, but they don't have the solid structure of this one. The Lost World is open for anyone who can't get enough dino, and thought the original didn't give em enough. Jurassic Park Three is Lost world Lite, but still entertaining, with even better CGI and a certain dumb charm. Hope the fourth shows a return to form.
10	Its an amazing science fiction film. one of speilbers most spellbinding works.
10	One of the best movies of all time!
9	A riveting adventure from start to finish.
10	Amazing Movie!! It's great how they made the Dino's, extremely realistic. Incredibly thrilling!
8	A great movie, it is one of its decades best. An amazing film that keeps you at a firm grip, and has you straight in engagement. A movie with visual effects that are still reaching our standards today.
10	Classic. one of the most thrilling movies of all time. i don't see how u can't enjoy this.
10	Wow, I can watch this over an over again when I feel like to, this movie is a fad. and a very good one.
10	It makes sense, and I am on Ian Malcolm's side of opinion of the island creation. i am astonished by how amazing the movie was.
10	A LEGENDARY movie, shame about the sequels. That's all that needs to be said really. It may not seem original, but wholly, it clearly is.
7	fun to look at, but overrated
10	This is truely my favorite movie of all time.
10	A modern classic.
0	The most overrated movie of all time.
5	Very generic action film with novelty effects. watchable once, but mostly boring.
10	A pure masterpiece! This is one of the greatest movies of all time. It may not have absolutely fantastic actors but the graphic effects and sound department definitely make up for it's loss! Nothing like this had ever been made at the time, which makes it even more special, it still amazes me today.
10	The Best Film of the 90's
9	Frankly, this movie is grealty underrated by critics, which just goes to show that while critics sometimes hit, sometimes they miss as well. While it is true that Titanic was awful, and made more money than it ever deserved to, ten years later no one remembers it. People remember Jurassic Park. The reality is that Jurassic Park was the beginning of an era. Up to that point, no one had done something nearly so ambitious. The effort gone into making the movie shows; the dinosaurs look amazing, and this movie pulls off something VERY few movies have done - seamless CG. The dinosaurs look like they're really there, and you can't tell when they're using animatronics and when they're using CG. Its amazing, and the movie is a visual masterpiece. Indeed, I would go so far as to argue that no movie since has managed the same level of realism with their CG monsters, simply because everyone is lazy. Comparing this to later movies, such as the new Star Wars movies, makes the Star Wars movies look dated and amateurish. But its not JUST the dinosaurs and their wonderful visuals. Its also a very solid plotline of man doing things with science, and due to arrogance get in real trouble. Sadly, it doesn't contain some of the awesome plotpoints of the book which underscore this, such as their automated tracking system which has an internal cap as to how many dinosaurs it would display because they only assumed that the number of dinosaurs could go down, not up. Sadly, this plot point is lost, so the hubris is lessened. Even so, while this movie isn't the best in terms of plot, it manages to be a great movie. While not a 10, its a 9 - a movie that everyone should see, because it is that good. Some of the characters aren't that great, but others are excellent, and overall the movie is a great effort and is fun to watch. In the end, a movie like this exists to entertain and maybe make people think about some possiblities, and this movie accomplishes both.
10	I used to watch this at the age of 3. Since then it has been my favourite movie always keeping me entertained. One of the best movies of all time in my own opinion. Definately one of Spielberg's best.
10	Dinosaurs are the coolest prehestoric animals in the whole world. thats why Steven Spielberg decided to make a science fiction movie about Dinosaurs and it kicked a**!
10	This movie is awesome. I first saw Jurassic Park as a little kid and loved it. I've probably seen it fifty times. I just finished watching it again on television and it is just as good as I remembered. This is definitely one of my all-time favorite films
10	A definite thrill ride and an experience of a lifetime. This movie might not have gotten all of the praise that Jaws got but it was this movie, alongside with the original Star Wars movies, that really created a whole new world for CGI characters and helped define the skill that a movie crew can possess. My favorite movie of all time and the one movie that will never get old.
9	This is a movie that offers something new and exciting, this was one of my favorite movies growing up, and the best in the series, if your a Dinosaur fanatic like myself you'll love this movie.
10	One of the best movies ever made, and a movie that has a special place in my heart. Honestly, I believe this movie should've won best picture at the Oscars, not Schindler's List.
8	This movie is one of my favorites, I've watched this movie so many times since I was five years. This movie is a classic that more acclaimed standing right next to so many other Spielberg masterpieces.
10	this is a boss like movie cuz it diosours and panads!
6	The main problem I had with jurassic park is that it doesn't live up to the incredibly high calibre of the cast and crew. Actors like sam neill and samuel l jackson are stuck in a simplistic action film with not much going for it. Don't get me wrong, steven spielberg brings his directing flair elevating this above your average monster film but the sub par script doesn't allow for character development with wayne knights character being a laughably stupid character. For that matter its nice to see that spielberg sticks to the convention that all characters in a monster movie are remarkably dumb. Overall the movie can provide long moments of tension and some great set pieces but not much else.
9	For anyone who was fascinated by dinosaurs as a kid, Jurassic Park is a godsend. It's fun, engaging and a well-told story. Spielberg does sentimental family films like no other, and Michael Crichton's ideas from the book the film is based on add a little extra intrigue to the story. Most of the cast are serviceable rather than outstanding, and the characters aren't the most interesting or original ever committed to film, though Laura Dern still impresses. The real stars of the show (as they should be) are the dinosaurs, proof that a combination of CGI and animatronics result in effects that age the least noticeably over time (the film is nearly 20 years old and the special effects are only just starting to look out of date). The set pieces are also fantastic, particularly the T-Rex reveal and the now infamous Velociraptor kitchen scene. Jurassic Park benefits in a real way from the dream-team combination of Spielberg's expert direction, Stan Winston's creature effects and John Williams' masterful score (easily among the finest he has ever composed), consequently the film is finely crafted and truly memorable. Scored purely on its value as a film, Jurassic Park probably deserves an 8, but since it's the most important film of my childhood, I'm prepared to bump it up to a 9.
10	A simply great movie, delivers all the thrills, laughs, and all in 2 hours. It gave CGI to the world, along with an unforgettable movie of Isle Nublar's tragedy. This is a must-have for anyone who is a fan of thrillers.
10	One of the greatest movies of all time - Spielberg is a genuis. I love everything about this movie, location, acting, characters, dinosaurs - such a stunning movie.
10	This movie inspired and awed me as a child. It's what dreams are made of. The incredible special effects and puppetry still hold up today. Great movie in my eyes.
10	I love this movie, one the greatest movies of all time, and a great adventure. It will never gets old. Steven Spielberg gives you a realistic picture of dinosours. It has very good music too. See it.
9	Brilliant action-packed film by Spielberg. CGI, dramatic scenes, and blood-thirsty animals make it thrilling, and worth watching. Unforgettable score and hair raising effects will give you a scare you'll never forget.
10	I first saw this back when I was little. If I remember correctly, it was also a big thing when it came out...I am always going to love this movie...It was one of the amazing film ever made in Hollywood by the great director Steven Spielberg who is the only director who thinks in a different way..Many who dislike Jurassic Park just all have same reason finding out little faults but anyone didn't show where the fault is properly..and also love the background music..it was truly Awesome... Jurassic Park â
10	As a wide-eyed 13 yr old boy gripping the theater armrests with white knuckles, I remember this film rewiring my brain as I watched it. I walked out a changed person, never to view movies the same way again. The good ones... the truly special ones... aren't just something to watch. They transport you to another world. They take you away and cleanse you of the drudgery of reality. They nestle into your memory and never leave. Jurassic Park was the first film to affect me in this way and I'll never forget that feeling. Much obliged, Mr. Spielberg!
7	Jurassic Park is surprisingly good, and I say "surprisingly," because I didn't know how much more I really wanted to watch after the first hour. Roughly the first 60 minutes is contaminated with utter boredom. In fact, most of this first hour wasn't even necessary. If I could crop out the 5-10 minutes of the first hour that were important, I imagine that the audience would still understand what was happening. Maybe it was just my inner-boy speaking, but I wanted to see some dinosaurs for cryin' out loud! But I digress. (To the film's credit, though, we do see some dinos before they begin their reign of terror, but most are in the background, one we only get a glimpse of his claw and eye. Only one dino is fully exposed, and it doesn't really do anything. And before the dinos start attacking, we see two more; a baby, as well as a sick triceratops). After you get past the first hour, the film quickly picks up. I won't say how many, but people do die (and we see two dismembered body parts before the film is over). To be honest, I've never seen a film that would truly qualify as "scary," but this certainly "freaked me out." I always thought dinos were terrifying creatures, but now that fear has been greatly multiplied. In addition to an excellent job on making the dinos appear so suddenly (you'll probably be startled by an un-expected reptile at least once), the dinos look incredibly real, despite the fact that this film is nearly 20 years old. The characters in the film weren't quite one-dimensional, but they weren't very fleshed out either. The plot was slightly outrageous, but if you can force yourself to believe it, the film is much more enjoyable. The score by legendary composer, John Williams, was something of a disappointment. This is by far the worst I've heard from him, though it's not that bad. It's serviceable, and sometimes, that's all one can ask for. Though there are times when the music is a little irritating and repetitive. The film is lots of fun, and it's truly scary. There are some comedy elements, but it's mostly for the fright and joy of seeing people chased by dinos. So, if that's what you came for, you won't be disappointed. That is, if you can get past that first hour.
9	Everytime I hear low rumbling of thunder off in the distance....I think of a t-rex outside my house because of this movie.
10	This is one of my favorite films of all time. It knows how to be scary, funny and fascinating, sometimes all in the same scene. The dinosaurs also look great, especially for the time period that it was made in.
10	A classic in itself. No movie made of dinosaurs has been more mesmerizing and dazzling. The score is sensational. It is one of those movies that transcends not only its genre but for all movies.
10	The games provides you with an amazing universe, if you love Jurassic Park you totally gonna enjoy the game. But certain parts like the technical problems and the fruststing quick time events may prevent you sometimes from having fun. However for that price its totally worth your effort in going out to buy this. Do it.
10	Classic movie. It's the undisputed all-time best Dinosaur movie to come out, and likely to be the best one to ever come out. It has an exciting plot, great performances, and action to support it. The effects were amazing; ahead of its time. The Dinosaurs looked incredibly, and terrifyingly realistic.
9	With a great cast, wonderful story, and unforgettably stunning soundtrack, "Jurassic Park" does not disappoint. Truly brilliant filmmaking here.
8	"Jurassic Park" is a wonderfully imagined film. It owes its greatness to digital wizardry, beautiful panoramas, and Michael Crichton's captivating novel.
7	Props to Steven Spielberg for creating a great movie! It is not the best movie ever made, or one of them, but it is still a treat to watch! The visual effects are top-notch and I enjoyed the action. A little slow during the first 10 minutes, but it does pick up. Diagnosis: See it!
10	Classic. The movie of my childhood. As then, now produces incredible impression. Now I'll know what to do, if I meet a tyrannosaur. Thanks to Dr. Grant :D
8	For its time the effects are spectacular. Soon will draw the remastered in 3D and it will be great.
7	In a generation where Jurassic Park was the pinnacle of CGI, its hard not to admire this thrilling and suspenseful adventure, but there are stumbling blocks which stopped this film from reaching its full potential. When a wealthy visionary (Richard Attenborough) needs expert approval before he can open is state of the art biological theme park, he turns to palaeontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotonist Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) for approval, due to the fact that there are living, breathing dinosaurs on the park, cloned from DNA of the creatures millions of years before. What ensues is greed, corruption, and the goal of wanting to be remembered as revolutionising how humans and dinosaurs can co-exist. When a power cut drops all security defences on the enclosures, its a fight for life against beautifully rendered prehistoric creatures. The build and tension is here, but its when the dinosaurs actually make an appearance that the movie start to become a little bland and it almost seems rushed, even though this is 120min plus film. Spielberg has created mastery in telling an excellent story, but the chemistry between the characters feels to forced and unnecessary, and it seemed premature to put Jeff Goldblum's eccentric character out of use so early with a bad leg. Saying that, the performances of Neill and Dern are strong, but the device of using shock and awe/wait for amazement does tend to overpower these performances. Its excellent for its generation, certainly better than the second instalment, but could have reached heights had it not been for a more concerning promotion of the technology at work here, a milestone of its own behalf, but could easily have been better.
10	Utterly beautiful, awe-inspiring, flawless and ground-breaking film that will forever be one of my childhood favourite films, and it still is one of my favourite films. Amazing.
10	Very exciting and mostly advanced film. When I saw it in 3D, I thought the 3D made the movie even better. The chase scenes are really exciting, and you get a sense of thrill when you watch it. If you don't see it, you have never seen real movies.
7	You can read my review/retrospective of the recent 3D re-release of "Jurassic Park" here http://geektasticfilmreviews.blogspot.com/2013/04/jurassic-park-3d.html
10	Jurassic Park is groundbreaking, engrossing, imaginative, and just amazing. I would watch it over and over again if I had the chance. There are 214 reviews of this movie, and 199 of them are positive, and if you watch the film, you'll see why. If you were ever interested in dinosaurs when you were little, you'll love this film, its like a dream come true for you. But for me, I never liked dinosaurs but I loved "Jurassic Park." Its a classic!
8	I wish the movie lived up to its classic score, but it doesn't. However, it is a groundbreaking picture that is filled with adventure and action. Entertaining and at times, epic.
10	most inspirational and exciting movie in my childhood.One of the most iconic movies of all time.A flawless masterpiece of a very rare kind.The real life looking dinosaurs are the greatest triumph for Spielberg in his long impressive filming career.One of the most memorable movies of all time.
10	One of Steven Spielberg's finest. I adore this movie and I love watching it again and again. Sam Neill will always be known as Alan Grant for the rest of his life. It is extremely remarkable how CGI from 20 years ago can still hold up today and is better than most special effects used in films today. Throughout, I felt like I was on Isla Nublar, being hunted down by a group of genetically created monsters. And the soundtrack just gives me goosebumps. An all-time great and a must-watch!
10	Jurassic Park packs in thrill, suspense, amazing visuals, great music and sensational acting all under the direct assurance of Steven Spielberg. This film triumphs in every major category. It is one of the greatest films of all time. A sensational classical monument of film history. Spielberg triumphs again!
9	Jurassic Park is an epic adventure fantasy film. It has everything that the audience wants action, suspense,some humor and a little violence as there are dinosaurs. The dinosaurs are really amazing as the technology was not that developed when Jurassic Park came out. The actors are really good, especially the two kids and it has a lot of suspense. I thought it wouldn't have so much blood and violence as I thought it was a PG movie, but I don't have these kind of problems. Jurassic park is epic and haters gonna hate. I was hesitating at first because I don't like dinosaurs and stuff but Jurassic Park amazed me and it is a classic one. A must-watch. Best film with dinosaurs for sure!
8	A great dinosaur movie to keep the kids up all night, it has a little something for the older ones; a story. Unlike some other monster movie, this one actually goes into some character development and has some great special effects for the year it came out.
8	Jurassic Park holds up surprisingly well to this day. It may not be the deepest or best written movie ever made, but it's one of the most thrilling. Spielberg is a master of creating tension and incredible set-pieces. Most of the visual effects are still adequate, which is incredible for a movie made in 1993. If a visual effects film holds up like that after 20 years there's a good chance it may never be completely antiquated. The script can be somewhat clunky at times however. It's not a bad script, just somewhat lacking when compared to something like The Truman Show or Inception. It's still more than functional for a monster movie, and the main characters are thankfully likeable if somewhat needing of more complex characterization. It's not perfect, but it's an extremely memorable and sometimes exhilarating action film that has deservedly gone down as a benchmark in movie history.
8	A true techno-thriller of dazzling special effects, vividly detailed plot elements, and a social allegory of how human greed need not be tempted by the prospects of science. 'Jurassic Park' is groundbreaking in CGI and proves Michael Crichton can turn even the most convoluted ideas into believable achievements. Though not as deep as the novel, it fairs well enough to be called faithful.
4	Jurassic Park is one of those films that you must have seen when first released (in theaters and home video) in order to really enjoy it. I just watched it for the first time and I just didn't care for it. It's took far to long to get the least bit interesting and even then it never really picks up.
7	This great, very nice and the composition is almost epic John Williams. But time was boring and there was more action adventure, a detail that does not fit in this movie. I actually like the music more than the plot. This is what I think of this work.
8	It's got intensity, excitement, great visuals and humor - almost everything you expect from a Spielberg movie. The movie also has some great, effective, suspenseful scenes that you make you be on the edge-of-your-seat.
10	This is one of my all time favorite movies I'm putting it that way this movie is an experience I grew up watching this movie and I never really appreciated it for what it was now I watch and am astounded at how great it is I watch this on surround sound and am just amazed at how immersive it is I love this movie and if you haven't seen it you will to.
4	( ALL ENTERTAINMENT) Here's the thing about the first Jurassic Park film. It's a very slow pace movie. Once the movie gets going then it's good. But for awhile it drags. The effects are extremely well done. The storyline is amazing. Everything was on key including the cinematography. I have to give it a score of 4 out of 10 though because the beginning is extremely slow. But other than that, it was amazing. By: Bailey (A Film Critic/Entertainment journal writer)
10	Alright i'm sure almost everyone has seen this movie by now and if not GET TO IT! I Love this movie such an awesome film, Everyone at one point loved dinosaurs in their lives and don't lie to yourself if you didn't =D. Yeah i was like 2 when this movie came out back in 1993 so when i heard about the 3D Re-Release i wasn't so mad as i have been with some of the other 3D Re-Releases that have come out the past couple years the film looks great in the post 3D conversion. Richard Attenborough Plays a multi millionaire named John Hammond that is about to open a theme park with cloned dinosaurs. They basically do a test run with a small group of people to see how the park operates. Soon the fun ends as the dinosaurs break free of their caged areas and the cast is left fighting to survive. Once things start to get going in the movie turns from a peaceful joyful ride to a thrilling heart pounding ride with loads of awesome scenes with a T-Rex, Triceratops, Velociraptors, etc it was just a blast going through the film on the big screen definitely worth that money And what can i say i just love Jeff Goldblum he is such a ladies man in this film even though he is a mathematician who specializes in chaos theory the guy even survives an attack by a T-Rex i think that qualify's him as PURE BADASS Overall i give this movie a 8.5 Such a Classic that i can never get tired of watching
10	Um otimo filme, toda o que um bom filme tem que ter, efeitos especias lindos(para a epoca), um dos melhores filmes que ja vi na vida. Steven Spirberg sabe fazer bons filmes, a ambientacÃ£o e espetacular, os atores, a dublagem e tudo lindo, o enredo e incrivel, enfim esse filme e prefeito do 10
10	Jurassic Park was my favourite film for over 15 months, because I found it so brilliant and possibly the most ingenious Steven Spielberg film he directed.
7	This one is certainly a ton of fun. The special effects are killer (lul) and the excitement they help to build is truly why Jurassic Park has gone down as a classic. Now, a lot of that is also likely thanks to 90s nostalgia and kids overhyping the movies they saw when they were 10, but all the same, Jurassic Park's special effects are a sight to behold. The terror and thrills are also ever present and really add an extra level of excitement to this one as you watch these huge beasts attack these people with childlike wonder. However, once you get snapped out of that childlike wonder, there are some issues, namely the acting. Laura Dern sucks here. The kids are not stellar. Then Richard Attenborough (RIP) is nothing more than alright. Luckily, Jeff Goldblum, Sam Neill, and Wayne Knight, are all fine, which is a plus. However, the acting of Dern is the true cause of much of my distress, as she was just straight up bad. There are also some cheesy scenes that really detract from the overall product. However, as a whole, Jurassic Park is very exciting and the special effects are just too impressive to look away even when the acting sucks.
8	Jurassic Park is Steven Spielberg's big-screen vision of Michael Crichton's famed novel about dinosaurs in the modern world. Stunning visuals and a killer plot, it's a classic and a classic of our time.
8	Yay!!!!!!! My 100th review is here!!!!!! Today, I'm going to do a short review of Steven Spielberg's classic that is simply known as: "Jurassic Park". Well, this classic has impressive special effects even for today's standards, a script that sometimes falls into typical clichÃ©s of modern blockbusters, a well-rounded cast and a soundtrack that won't go over my head that easily. I plan to see its sequels but I will give it a rest just to analyse my next movie: Daredevil.
10	It's one of the best movies of the history, without this movie, we wouldn't seen movies like avatar, the avengers, this movie was the mom of all those movies. It's a movie that have an awesome story, special effects, never seen before to that moment, if you like dinosaur your gonna love this movie. With this movie, Steven Spielberg, make the dinosaurs, ruled the earth again.
10	Jurassic Park is still one of the best disasters films ever made. The effects are so amazing it really is hard to believe this came in 1993. Oh and Jeff Goldblum is in it so it must be a good movie.
10	Jurassic Park transports you to a whole new world with groundbreaking special effects that still hold up today, i watched this movie when i was young and loved it and still love it, the characters are interesting and funny, especially Jeff Goldblum which people go too hard nowadays, the heart of the movie comes from Richard Attenborough's performance, the action is great but never goes on for too long, Jurassic Park is a great movie for all ages that stands as one of the greatest movies ever made, i'll definitively give this a 10.
10	Featuring incredible special effects and action-packed drama, Jurassic Park takes you to a remote island where an amazing theme park with living dinosaurs is about to turn deadly, as five people must battle to survive among the prehistoric predators.
10	My job drop when I first saw this movie in 1993, at the tender age of 4. In 2014, at the edge of 25 my jaw continues to drop every time I pop this masterpiece into my blu ray player. If anything, the years have helped this masterpiece remind us what a truly excellent blockbuster movie is about!
10	To this day, still remains one of my favourite movies of all time. That's saying something considering I usually regard movies poorly. It has everything and more, with the inclusions of dinosaurs. How in all honesty can one beat that? This was epic on the grandest of scales when it launched in 1993, and still amazes me to this day. Storyline is beautiful, all roles are excellently portrayed and for it's time, a true marvel that should still be respected today. 10/10
10	This movie revolutionized my childhood. Probably the first movie I have ever watched, "Jurassic Park" still has the magic that I felt when I was a kid. AFI did well classifying this movie as one of the best thrillers ever made in america cinema. Director Steven Spielberg carefully worked with the emotions of the characters, making it a non-dolt thriller, as, unfortunately, most of them are made this way today. It has the quantity of visual effects that was supposed to have, it has a saturated story, no kinds of exaggeration, in no way possible. "Jurassic Park" is, and forever will be, a reference to the future of cinema.
10	Jurassic Park is movie based off the novel and is about archaelogists getting a chance to see real life dinosaurs. It has revolutionary CGI especially for the time, awesome scenes, and suspense. 10/10 (Legendary)
8	Rewatched it recently on BD. I haven't seen this movie in ages and its still as good as I remembered. Good story, decent acting, some nice effects for the that time.
8	Watching this movie for the first time as an adult, I was completely amazed by how good it was--I always assumed it must be overhyped, but it completely deserves its reputation as a classic. The pacing is perfect, with a long, slow-burn lead-up to the scary dinosaur scenes we all know are coming. The special effects hold up amazingly well more than 20 years later--they manage to avoid the kitschy funniness of most outdated effects. This is a wonderfully enjoyable movie that I'll definitely be watching again.
9	This is perhaps the earliest movie I remember watching and what a movie it is to remember. The dinosaur effects are great, the characters are good, and the story is memorable. Sure, the paleontology is off at times (the Velociraptors being the same size as us and being superintelligent for example) but I don't care because this movie is awesome.
10	one of my favorite films of all time. I think this movie is amazing the dinosaurs look real if they where there and this in my opinion is the best Steven Spielberg of all time.
9	Few movies have ever managed to captivate me the way this one did. I watched it on opening night when it first came out in theatres. Then about a dozen more times after that. I bought the VHS, DVD, Blu Ray, book, sound track, trading cards, stickers, posters, even had a Jurassic Park tie at one point. So yeah, I'm a huge fan. When it first came out, it was a visual marvel. Today the CG sequences do show their age, but luckily most of the practical effects still hold up, a testimony to why animatronics is still valid. Great story, it does deviate a bit from the book but not too much. Interesting characters, but the dialogue now does feel a little hammy at time. Overall: Jurassic Park is one of my favourite movies from my childhood. While it is a little dated now, it still holds up remarkably well, considering its age.
8	On a small island off the coast of Costa Rica exists a most unusual animal preserve by the name of Jurassic Park. Operated by dinosaur lover John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), Jurassic Park is the first of its kind. Its population of creatures includes brachiosaurs, dilophosaurs, tricerotops, velociraptors, and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, each of which has been cloned using the latest technology that takes DNA from dinosaur-biting prehistoric insects preserved in amber, and uses that DNA for the re-creation. When the consortium funding Jurassic Park become concerned that all is not as it should be, Hammond is forced to call in three experts: paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), his partner, paleo-botanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and the brilliant-but-cynical mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). When the trio arrives at Jurassic Park, they are astonished by what it represents. It doesn't take long, however, for astonishment to turn to horror. First of all, for anyone who's wondering, given the current state of technology, the situation postulated in Jurassic Park cannot happen. Not only do the necessary cloning techniques not exist, but the likelihood of retrieving dinosaur DNA from an amber-encased prehistoric mosquito is extremely small. While insect specimens have been unearthed, for there to be dinosaur DNA, circumstances demand that the mosquito had bitten a dinosaur shortly before its fatal imprisonment, and the chance of that is slim, at best. Nevertheless, the enjoyment of any movie is hardly predicated by a factual premise. The apparent realism of some of Crichton's pseudo-science imbues Jurassic Park with a grounding that is acceptable in our high-tech world. After all, to weave a dinosaur fable in this day and age, it helps if science, not fantasy, is the driving force. Of course, the special effects help immensely. They are so good, in fact, and the dinosaurs look so real, that I half expected to see "dinosaur trainer" during the closing credits. Instead, however, plaudits go to the creators of Jurassic Park's primary screen presences (all apologies to the actors). Stan Winston, definitely no stranger to this sort of film (his recent credits include Aliens and Terminator 2), is credited with the live-action creatures. Dennis Muren gets his due for the full motion monsters. Phil Tippett is the "dinosaur supervisor" and Michael Lantieri presides over the creature effects. All-in-all, the wizards at ILM have done an outstanding job, giving us by far the most impressive and believable monster movie of all time. Nothing compares. Unfortunately, the story isn't the equal of its execution. To begin with, Crichton's book, while filled with fascinating ideas and entertaining moments, doesn't hold together as a top-of-the-line adventure story. The ending is especially problematic, resulting in a long-winded denouement that drags to an anticlimactic conclusion. Despite numerous small changes and omissions, the movie Jurassic Park is very much faithful to its printed inspiration. Perhaps Michael Crichton's involvement in the screenplay has something to do with this. The plot is little more than a cleverly jumbled-together batch of formulas. As I mentioned before, Jurassic Park is, reduced to its most basic level, a monster movie. Thrown in for good measure is the human interest story - the growing relationship between self-confessed child-hater Grant and his two youthful charges - but this part of the film works least successfully. Nevertheless, I doubt that there are many who will go to Jurassic Park for its characters or story. Rightly so, crowds will flock to the theaters screening this movie so they can ooh and aah, jump in their seats, and root for the overmatched humans against the big, bad dinosaurs. Even those familiar with the written work can't help being drawn in to the pulse-pounding exhilaration of the chase as the Tyrannosaurus menaces two powerless electric cars and the trapped humans inside. In the end, Jurassic Park succeeds because it's good entertainment.
9	Jurassic Park is a masterpiece. It is an achievement. One of the greatest achievements in cinema history. Jurassic Park is one of the best family film out there. You can enjoy this movie any time. I love this movie so much.
10	Brilliant! I loved it! The cgi-especially for 1993-was fantastic! Abslolutely brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7	Jurassic Park is a fun dinosaur movie with good morals. Normally Iâ€™m not too big on action but it is well handled. The film creates likeable/relatable characters, builds up the threat of the dinosaurs, uses mostly practical effects, and while it may take a while for the film to get to the action when it gets there it is fun and well earned being intense along with wonderful to look at. While the film has some nice morals they do feel a little forced in as they are mainly delivered through exposition while the action is fun and entertaining. Jurassic Park is a fun movie that doesnâ€™t need a sequel but it is getting a fourth one.
10	Estamos ante una obra maestra de proporciones epicas, un villano tan carismatico, una trama que se vuelve interesante y con giros inesperados, es la mejor pelicula de superheroes hasta ahora, bueno eso de superheroes o mejor dicho antiheroe, porque Batman no es un heroe, es el caballero de la noche.
10	The atmosphere is very intense in the movie, like the comics. Also Heath Ledger's performance was brilliant, he achieved to show the psychotic and crafty side of Joker. Story was fluent and deliberative, it makes you think after you watch it. But, it was not like a superhero movie. It was like a exciting psychological crime movie. That's the only disadvantage maybe but I ignore it, because Batman has more serious style than the other superheroes. He's like a detective rather than a superhero. After all, this movie is a masterpiece of Nolan. Deserves 10 out of 10.
10	If one movie captured what it was like to live in the post-9/11 decade, this is it. This is the movie of a generation. It seems to lack a traditional narrative structure, instead pounding away relentlessly with jump scares, psychological horror, and real action. Terse direction and a chilling manical score drive the action. The bank robbery prologue remains one of the classic film openings, but memorable scenes and quotable dialogue abound, culminating in the epic Batman/Joker interrogation scene. People rightfully remember the profound tragedy of Heath Ledger's death so soon after this iconic performance, but there is an abundance of strong acting. Aaron Eckhart provides a nuanced foil before making a scary turn, and Maggie Gyllenhall sells the horror of the Joker's machinations, and of course Christian Bale somehow conveys the weight of the world being on his shoulders in an oddly thankless role. Largely grounded in reality, the film nonetheless reveals plot holes and implausibilities upon rewatching. However, it is a testament to it greatness that despite the Joker's seemingly impossible schemes or the muddled ending, the emotional impact of the film as a whole remains untarnished. The film's brilliance is that in the climax with an unknown everyman, not a superhero, is given a choice to kill or be killed, the film genuinely sells that he might go either way, and the audience invests in his decision. Even a cynic cannot watch The Dark Knight without laughing at its black humor, squirming at its horrors, and doing some self-evaluation afterwards. What has fear done to us? What is the right response to terror? Where do we go from here? Simultaneously a work of cinematic art, a philosophical treatise, and a pop culture classic, this movie's place in history cannot be denied.
5	The dark knight pivots around this one premise: there is good and there is bad and there is nothing in between. This black and white morality is embodied in the characters of the insane Joker and the angelic Batman. The one kills with the least provocation, indiscriminately because even his own henchmen and allies are killed in an offhand, often gruesome, way. The other avoids killing in the most desperate and chaotic of situations and we see him, in his human form as Bruce Wayne, flounder in his dalliance with Rachel. For Bruce is a gentleman and as a gentleman he would not impose himself upon a woman. He is the knight, a dark knight, but a knight non the less. Joker exists to tempt Batman into falling from his shining white pedestal for no other reason then to proof that he will, if push came to shove. Thou shalt not kill..unless one has to and then one is damned for all eternity. And it is Joker who will do the pushing and shoving, until he gets Batman to do something that is 'wrong'. And eventually he will.. Of course he will... It is all hogwash. The movie, clamored to be the more realistic of them all, might be what it claims to be, but it is still unrealistic and, to boot, based on an abject morality. There is dark and there is light, and just one wrong deed is enough to turn white into black, because here is nothing in between. Intentions do not matter and it just takes one wrong deed to have people abandon Batman to the wolves, for he is a vigilante that ought to be put in jail, even though the purposefully made inept law enforcement agencies can not deal with the likes of a Joker or, for that matter, any other villain. Unless Batman helps them of course. Ironically the movie has no reason to be from the start, for Batman is a vigilante and thus acts outside the law. Case closed, the movie has lost it's macGuffin. The whole movie revolves around unrealism. Joker can command hordes of henchmen, who cater to his every whim. Unexplained is why these henchmen serve a psychotic murderer who has no problem in killing them at the blink of an eye. They just do. Unexplained is where Joker gets the means. He just has them, in abundance. Unexplained is how Joker knows things. He just does. The image is not of a man gone insane, but of supernatural being that has come to earth to do evil. Is Joker Satan? So in what is it then more realistic? Is it the style that has been stripped down to the level that there is no style at all? Where the comics are drawn in stark dark colors, gritty details, unusual angles and unsettling stylistic elements, the movie has abandoned all of it. The cinematography is mediocre. Shots are wasted, like the one that sees a conference with a long table and rows of chairs, but the camera fails to use the obvious opportunity to align the shot along the table, using a focused angle that zooms in on Bruce Wayne sleeping, while the people are talking about him. The camera is used in a 'safe' fashion. Lighting is just done away with. While to comics show a fascinating play of shadows, the movie does not use that at all. Is it then realistic in the way people behave? Is it in the way that people do not think twice to show no loyalty to Batman at all? Or is it in the way cops fail to spot that their fellow policemen have been replaced by Jokers henchmen? Or is it in the way a mobster engages in a standup open fight and forgets that he has to reload the damn thing? Or is it in the way the crime-bosses let themselves be bullied by Joker? Is there then any realism in the story line? You mean in the way the omniscient and omnipresent Joker terrorizes Gotham to the point that the citizens are willing to offer up their hero to the mercy of that madman? For that is the whole story and it takes more then two hours to tell something that did not have anything substantial to explore after the first half. There are far better movies that examine the themes of good and bad in a more down-to-earth and humane way. Serpico springs to mind, or Taxi Driver or Fort Apache, the Bronx. All of whom score lower then this movie. The irony is that Dark Knight is praised for what a Batman movie ought not to be. It ought to be unrealistic, stylish, shot with unusual angles, using stark contrasts, snappy dialogues and allow for Catwoman. Catwoman, you say? Catwoman? Yes... because what is she? Is she black? Is she white? No.. she is shaded grey, the color that this movie has no knowledge of.
10	Absolutely stunning. This sequel is dark, sophisticated, and is better than its predecessor. It has emotion, powerful and superb acting, and impressive visuals. This film is, beyond any doubt, a must-see. Oh, and the Joker in the movie, is beyond fantastic.
9	Where to begin with this brilliant superhero film... Well one of the outstanding reasons would have to be The Joker (Heath Ledger), firstly the performance by him in this film is fantastic and absolutely deserved the Oscar for best supporting actor. Another reason why this is a great feature and most definitely the best of the trilogy is because there's no stupid backstory that's just a load of nonsense, the Joker is just simply crazy or messed up and even as Michael Caine says in the film 'Some people just wanna watch the world burn' the joker mentions a few times about his past and how he got his scars but changes them each time so no ones actually sure what's wrong with him. I also think Christian Bale plays a great Batman, compared to George Clooney or almost any of the others Christopher Nolan is a great director and has directed many great films and this is right up there with the others and deserved all the credit it got! A definite 9/10
10	This movie is not just an excellent comic book movie, it is one of the best movies ever made. It incorporate elements from multiple genres (crime,action,suspense,horror,psychological..............). Solid performances from all the actors makes this plot heavy movie one of Nolan's best. P. S. Heath Ledger as Joker is AWESOME!!!!!
9	The best of the trilogy. It manages to keep your attention all the time. And just when you think the day is saved, it all crash down. Ledger plays the role of his life as the Joker, a new and wonderful vision of this batman nemesis
10	This thing has everything a movie could ask for: a complex set of themes that raise questions about morality and philosophy, but with enough action, memorable dialogue, tight pacing, and character development to not get bogged down by its complexity. Ledger's Joker is, needless to say, one of the greatest movie villains of all time. The whole cast brings its A-game, ultimately creating the best superhero movie and arguably one of the best films of all time.
10	Christopher Nolan clearly is one of the few directors of comic book movies who actually cares. You can tell, because he elevated this movie from a simple comic book movie to an action packed thriller. The first thing I would like to talk about is Heath Ledge. Wow. His performance blows my mind every time. As the Joker, he is a murderous psychopath. He really makes all of the tense scenes work. Christian Bale plays a great Batman, as per usual. Everything in this movie looks real, and that's because most of it is. Nolan is not a fan of CGI. These stunts are real. Speaking of these stunts, the action sequences are also done incredibly. This is a must see, comic book fan or not.
9	Nearly every aspect of this film is fantastic. The creative designs and aesthetics of the movie are very pleasing, from the designs of Batman's suit and arsenal to the sprawling city of Gotham. Hans Zimmer's composing is, as always, genius. The Jokers theme is one of the highlights of this soundtrack, complementing the character perfectly. The acting in the film is top notch, Christian Bale and Gary Oldman deliver more rock solid performances and newcomer Aaron Eckhart also packs a punch as Harvey Dent/Two Face. But Heath Ledger steals the show as the, in my opinion, best interpretation of the Joker's character in any Batman media. The story is tense, well paced, and thrilling. The Dark Knight is easily one of the best Superhero movies ever made.
10	master piece!!!! the action, the lines, the reality for a hero. . . . is just amazing i think this movie goes for my top 5 of all times . . .btw so much jealous people hiting 0 score -_-
10	My favourite film of all time. This movie is absolutely incredible. Heath Ledgers portrayal as Joker is amazing and my favourite character ever in a movie. I can't praise this movie enough. It is just so dark and all the acting is amazing. If you haven't seen this movie make sure you check it out best film I have ever seen!!
10	The best superhero movie I've ever seen. Ledgar's performance is perhaps the greatest acting I've seen. This is a dark, realistic, action-packed masterpiece
10	Rare breed of film which is both serious and impossibly entertaining. Why so serious. The acting is first rate with already classic landmark performances from Ledger and Bale, with strong supporting acts from, Oldman, Freeman and Caine. The audience are able to feast there eyes on cinematic magic from the breathtaking visual effects, shown extensively through the chase scenes with the Bat-pod and Lorry. Whiles Hanz Zimmers theme keeps you heart pounding throughout the film. The film which is already seen as a classic for the genre has no major shortcomings though of course people will dig plot holes. Definitely the best superhero film of all time, though a wide range of successful themes allow it to almost transcend its genre. Ultimately its Nolan at his very very best and i can think of no higher praise than that.
10	Theres only so many franchises where the 2nd film is the best. The Dark Knight is hands down the best Batman movie but also the best superhero movie. everything one could want in a superhero film. it takes superhero movies to a whole new level. here are my ratings: 1. Cast: 10/10 2. Action: 9/10 3. Score: 10/10 4. Effects: 10/10 5. Theater experience: 10/10
10	A single movie, with so many unique particularities and a simple proposal: be original and different at same time. Nolan brings us a mature and surprising BatmanÂ´s universe, with characters well made, including the Joker, the most impressive of all. Heath Ledger gives life to a scary, cold, shocking and overwhelming villain, that faces all Batman's limits with an unmerciful psychological game at absolutely flawless and triumphant performance. With a tense, accurate and efficient score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, led by the realistic and audacious proposal from Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight is engaging and powerful, being the best adaptation of a comic-book to the cinema.
10	The perfect Batman movie. Realistic and grounded, creating a perfect world where Batman can exist but we also can feel like it is real. Very complex especially for a comic book movie.. actually it is so much more than a superhero movie... it is a crime drama with Batman characters. And that makes it so awsome. Great performances (especially from Heath Ledger), storytelling, directing, everything!
9	While Batman Begins was a good film, The Dark Knight is grand. It's darkness and it's intense action will hold you captivated throughout the film. Christian Bale did an excellent performance playing Batman, I don't know why people are hating on his voice. The drama was cool, there were some emotional scenes, I overall had an amazing time when I first saw this film and I kind of want to watch it again right now. This is probably the greatest Batman movie ever made, so I would highly recommend it.
10	Thanks to great acting, amazing performance by Heath Ledger and brilliant guidance by director Christopher Nolan this movie is destined to be remembered forever.
0	This movie is so dry, pretentious and humorless that my cat became depressed after watching it with me and starved herself to death. Also all the expository dialogue and mindless pop philosophy made me schizophrenic. I'm now sharpening my knives and ordering the Halloween mask from EBay. Close your windows, Chris "Pretentious Hack" Nolan, I'm gonna avenge my kitty!
10	Easily the best movie ever made. Joker was more than outstanding. Christian bale was the best batman, the only reason the other users think he's just avg is because he couldn't do what heath ledger did.
10	The best Superhero/Comic book movie of all time. This is one of the movies that made Batman so popular today and lets not forget Heath Ledgers amazing portrayal of The Joker. The story was amazing and was never predictable, new things kept popping up keeping the plot fresh and never stale. 10/10
10	"The Dark Knight" is proof that Chris Nolan saved the Batman saga. this is literally the best Batman movie we ever had in years! from the mind-blowing action, to the incredible acting, fantastic characters, strong script, layers of character depth and development, epic music, awesome special effects... i can't see anything wrong with "The Dark Knight". cause everything's the work of art, of a person who knows how to do the Batman saga justice. it's like if Christopher Nolan was like "Outta the way, **** It's my turn now". and he saved Batman, he brought Batman back to life again, and i thank him so much for that. also, Heath Ledger as the Joker: a phenomenon! other actors can try, but nobody's ever gonna top Heath Ledger's Joker. and Christopher Nolan still stays as one of the best directors we've ever had. "The Dark Knight" is a phenomenon!
10	Overrated my left testicle. This movie is dark, complex, clever, unforgettable and Heath Ledger's performance is completely phenomenal and memorable. Christian Bale did another great job with this movie and once again, Christopher Nolan proves that he does not only deserves an Oscar for best director, he also proves that we can always trust on him.
10	This is a monumental piece of cinema. No film has ever portrayed chaos so well. Ledger gave one of the best performances in cinema history, Nolan's masterful directing has never been more prominent, weaving The Dark Knight into the best action movie ever made. The Dark Knight is a beautiful tale of destruction, a flawless take on crime, and a plea to mankind's nature. Christopher Nolan creates a world where being a hero is a double edged sword, at best, and yet that hero keeps doing his job. An absolutely fantastic piece of work, that every person on this world should see.
10	The Dark Knight is as much of a superhero film as it is a horrifying tragedy. With excellent casting, twisted and sickening characters and a devious plot make this the most outstanding Batman film in history. 10/10
9	I found The Dark Knight to be great film, living up to it's name. Although it is a shame about Ledger's death. He played The Jokers part perfectly. No one could have played the chaotic clown any better than Heath Ledger. As for Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne to be very exceptional as well. The movie itself and the plot to be devised exceptionally well. With Gotham in diss array and Batman trying to clean up the streets and is shunned by the law; while a megalomaniac is on the loose blowing up hospitals and killing without remorse. A great work of Art, better than the other two films in my opinion. Introducing Aaron Eckhart as Two Face; I found to be very exciting to see, seeing as he's one of my favorite DC villains. Although the film is very long and some parts to be boring it's the little things that was fantastic. With Ledger's fantastic portrayal and improvised parts, showing the Joker in his true form. This movie will be cherished and remembered for decades and the one of the greatest live action Batman movie.
9	A masterpiece by Christopher Nolan! Nowadays, we see a massive amount of computer generated objects in our movies. But with Nolansâ€™s The Dark Knight, we notice that he really tries to make the batman franchise as real as possible. Just look at the Batmobile, so incredible! I totally love the action and crime in The Dark Knight, and both the opening scene and the ending was just awesome. Iâ€™m also amazed by how groovy the movie was, and with the great music and the awesome actors couldn't the movie have been done better. Every small detail in the movie is perfect, except that there are some confusing and slow scenes in some places. The Dark Knight is a spectacular movie, and the best to date by Nolan. 9,3/10
10	THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!! all the actors in this movie was great, Especially heath ledger as the Joker. the story was really really good. don't die before you watch this movie
10	This is my favorite movie. I like Christopher Nolan movies. This is his best movie. Good plot, fantastic acting. Heath Ledger is genius. Good effects, action, drama.
3	I really think people might have fell into the hype of this movie a lot too much, besides Heath Ledger this movie is not that good. I can think of one word to describe this movie and that word is OVERRATED.
10	The Batman film everyone should deserve, even for people who don't like Batman. The films atmosphere, relatable characters, well-done action scenes, tension building are the things films need more of these days. The Dark Knight is a film I watch just to remind me what any other film but this one should try and be like. I mentioned action scenes separately because they are one the biggest highlights for me. Every single scene ranging from fist fights and car chases is perfectly edited and choreographed to show the realistic Batman in action. The car chase showing the Joker trying to catch Harvey Dent is perhaps the most detailed and perfectly executed piece of cinematography in film history. It might be a little disappointing that they got rid of the Bat mobile so suddenly and without warning. However the bat cycle blends in perfectly with one of Batman's many fantastic vehicles for the trilogy. Batman himself has become much more easy to take seriously which is saying a lot. He has now moved on from his only works by himself cycle in the first film, and now shows him with Harvey Dent and Jim Gordon working together to take down crime in the city. All the while knowing that Batman is a vigilante. Bruce Wayne is now still onto Rachel despite her having found out his secret in the last film, who has now moved onto Harvey Dent and seems to use Bruce's secret against him as would anyone. However the most interesting character for me is the joker himself. He is perhaps the most well-chosen actors for the part as Heath Ledger portrays him in a way its creepy. He is a man driven by nothing but chaos and the very destruction around him. He is also driven to bring down the Batman. This is a brilliant plot device since the Joker has nothing to sacrifice but his very life. Whereas Batman has his social life and his secret identity at stake. The Joker only wants Batman to give in. This is good for tension building because the audience are with Batman and realise that the Jokers plan is technically impossible to beat unless Batman... well, kills him. I won't go any further because I am positive that you've already heard enough hype for this film, and let me say that The Dark Knight has lived up to every bit of it and more.
10	By far the best super hero/batman film ever made, the second best film of all time in my opinion behind shawshank redemption, every actor gives a excellent performance especially heath ledger
9	unbelievable!!! this movie is so good the acting by Heath Ledger as the joker is amazing the joker is also very well made on script to. The action is great to the whole movie is just incredible very well done best superhero flick ever. my ratting 9.5/10 a 9 for action 10 for acting 8.5 for story 9.5 for style and a 8.5 for character development
8	I know that this might sound to consistent but this is probably the best superhero film of all time, the camera work, the makeup design (The Joker) , the direction, the writing and especially the performances are just great, Christian Bale really gives Batman some finesse and intimidation and handles the character well, Ledger's last performance was just great, i didn't think of him as that kid from Brokeback Mountain or 10 Things I Hate About You, i actually thought that he was a sociopath, and that is what i call amazing character study. Nice supporting cast as well. Christopher Nolan's best movie that's for sure
6	What I don't like about "Batman" films is that they seem out of this world. Well, there is something interesting in portraying an anti-hero's struggle with his inner weaknesses, because all of us do have weaknesses to overcome. But besides that there is nothing else. Except for Wayne, characters seem sickly one-sided and pretty unconvincing. Any attempt to make a strong point is concealed by the beautifully directed CGI effects. But Ledger's enchanting performance is a reason to watch this film on its own.
9	Is it overrated? Absolutely. It suffers from the same problems as Batman Begins- namely, the over-reverential script and the over-analysis of the movie's themes. But this one is much better, and I can explain why in five words: Heath Ledger as the Joker. This is the one part of the movie that deserves as much praise as it got. Ledger finds that tiny, tiny spot between funny and terrifying and milks it for all it's worth. He's a wounded puppy-dog of a jester who won't hesitate to slice your mouth in two or blow up a cruise ship, and he'll be laughing all the way. Also, he's the only actor in the crowd who can ably handle Nolan's Script and fuse it into his character, though that might be more of the Joker psychology that Ledger's acting. Whatever it is, he nails it. I just wish the rest of the movie was as clever and nuanced as him.
3	The dark knight is not a superhero film but a film about a messed up rich guy who wears a clad black suit like a pornstar and some psychotic hippy clown criminal who has a confusing personality. That's right folks I'm calling this film not the best because it has no super in it and gives you a sad and disappointing view of real life. The plot, characters, and whole presence makes you so pissed off and the critics call it the perfect superhero film what a load of **** Yeah I just said it **** and who really cars if I say a few swear words, it just my own opinion. The most part that makes me angry is that health ledger's joker is the supervillain, I prefer the Jack Nicholson version and to give a dead guy a award for good acting is like walking off a bridge. I admit some of the action scenes were cool but I'm no batman fan. I'm a loyal superman fan and I think the man of steel is way better than this crappy film. So that's my review of a extremely overrated film that died so much in disgrace that it could never make me pleasant
9	Christian Bale is a perfect Bruce Wayne, no doubting that. His voice as Batman kept cracking me up, but at the same time he does play the Dark Knight very well, so it is only a momentary fun every time. (No doubt helps him to hide his true identity too.) A lot has been talked about Heath Ledger's role in the movie, and those acclaims have been very true, too. He is a perfect Joker; on the very borderline of sane and its complete opposite. Disturbing, and yet in a way very human. This movie, compared to "Batman Begins", is smoother, more action-filled and on the move all the time. People get killed, shots fired, cars trashed, buildings blown... All in all, this is a near perfect movie. Dark, aggressive, twisted and very funny in a lot of places as well - much thanks to the Joker.
7	The Dark Knight is monumental. One of the biggest fan favorites of the decade. Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances of all-time as The Joker amidst engrossing chaos. It may be ever-so-slightly overrated, especially with an average portrayal of Batman from Christian Bale.
9	Despite being overrated, The Dark Knight shows viewers a strong villain and dark atmosphere. Sadly, Heath Ledger died postumously to its release however, he still earned a Oscar for best supporting actor and cemented himself in film history.
10	Â¿La mejor pelÃ­cula de superhÃ©roes? Absolutamente. Â¿La mejor pelÃ­cula de la historia? Es muy probable. Una trama perfecta que hace que dos horas sean diez minutos, el mismo reparto aun mejor, EL MEJOR VILLANO DE LA HISTORIA, grandes efectos especiales, diÃ¡logos brillantes, situaciones memorables, un final redondo. Todo en esta pelÃ­cula, lo mires por donde lo mires, es perfecto. Nada falla. El Joker es punto y aparte. Creo que jamÃ¡s volverÃ© a ver algo como El Caballero Oscuro. JamÃ¡s.
10	Has to be one of my favourite films of all time, filled with action, you are gripped to the TV, also Heath Ledger does an excellent job as the joker, in the facial expressions, to the small details. Overall an amazing movie.
10	It truly is an outstanding CBM, and a great film in general. The acting, the cinematography, and writing are all top notch. There's not much else I can say that hasn't already been said.
10	Because, Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, and, yes, Christopher Nolan rocked the show. The movie is a take apart from the comical Joker in DC Comics, and the mentally-affected Harvey Dent. These two elements raised the thrill completely. The best superhero flick, till now. Intensity redefined. Mind-blowing plot, brilliant sequences.
10	An aesthetically beautiful and well written film. The actors committed and I can tell they put their emotions into each and every scene. Thumbs up all around on this very intelligently written art piece. Easily one of my favorite films.
10	This is one of the best superhero movies ever with excellent performance from Heath ledger and acceptable performance from all actors and actresses and five star narratives.
10	Batman raises the stakes in his war on crime. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague the city streets. The partnership proves to be effective, but they soon find themselves prey to reign of chaos unleashed by a rising criminal mastermind known to the terrified citizens of Gotham as the Joker.
10	Well where do I start Nolan's films are always great but this is the best Bale is amazing but is nothin compared to Heath ledgers Acting if you say he won cause he died just watch him the film has a great plot terrifying moments great villains and an unbeatable hero well done Chris.
10	This movie is the my best movie of all time. Heath ledger acting was OUTSTANDING. His every dialogue is just legendary. The starting scene(bank robbery) is just great. I have watched this movie many times and i never get tired of watching this movie
9	Continuing from where Batman Begins ended peerless director Christopher Nolan reunites with Christian Bale for the continuing story of The Dark Knight. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent Batman sets out to put a halt to the criminal activity that plagues Gotham City. Just as everything seems to be going their way the peace is shattered by a criminal mastermind known as The Joker. Batman may be on the DVD cover but this is really The Jokers movie. Following the death of Heath Ledger prior to the movies release there was huge hype regarding his performance and he certainly delivers. His portrayal is a far cry from the camp 1960s iteration and as creepy and disturbing as any villain in cinema history. Running at about two and a half hours in length The Dark Knight needed a worthwhile plot to go with the high quality action scenes and on this count the movie again doesn't fail featuring plenty of twists and surprises. The Dark Knight is without doubt the best super hero movie of all time.
9	Simply put, this is the greatest superhero movie ever made. It is the best on so many different levels, no other superhero movie has such prominent actual thought provoking moments, no other superhero movie has such a captivatingly unhinged villain, and really no other superhero more is this thrilling. It builds on the promise of Batman Begins and achieves heights few other movies can hope of achieving.
10	By combining epic action akin to Michael Mann, an endearing cast and a blisteringly psychotic antagonist; Nolan has dropped his hero in the realms of realism and forever changed the superhero genre.
10	The Dark Knight is the closest any superhero movie has come to "perfect" with transcendent dialogue, a sturdy plot and marvelous casting including Heath Ledger's iconic portrayal of The Joker all assured under Christopher Nolan's masterful direction.
10	Easily the best movie of not only the Nolan batman trilogy, but of his entire career, this is without a doubt the perfect superhero movie. Its hero truly is a hero, not one who does what he does for the glory, but for doing the right thing, regardless of how much those he serves hate him in return. The hero is not perfect, as he does fall, showing even further his immense humanity. The villain is not a stock character who is easily defeated, but a man with a troubled and unclear past, whose genius seems to always win. The battle for Gotham's soul is fought between a strict moral code and nihilism, the immovable object and the unstoppable force.
10	The Dark knight is definitely one of the best movie of all times, It put a batman on the sky, the performance of Christian Bale and Heath Ledger are OUTSTANDING!, All the characters played a strong role, this movie has everything, amazing soundtrack, and story, epic battles, best action fights!, the best movie of christopher nolan! this will become a classic movie.........
10	This film is the perfect super hero movie. Gotham City is displayed so well visually. It is full of a great cast, and everyone is sharp in this film. I really need to see this movie again. What more can be said about the Dark Knight? Heath Ledger is dynamite as the joker which every knows by now. If you have not seen this movie yet go out and see it. You won't regret it.
10	This film is a beautiful metaphor for the greatest struggles of life itself; I have recently discovered that Nolan's masterpiece seems to address the problems created by a figurative or literal multiple personality disorder. We have three different angles of perspective on life, all grabbing for Rachel, who represents love, in one way or another. Harvey Dent is essentially a saint, an idyllic hero driven by hope and compassion that has presumably only been able rise up to the challenge of fixing Gotham City due to the changes set in place by Bruce Wayne, who sees the world for what it truly is: a hellish, twisted roller coaster of synthetic euphoria and very real pain. He too, though, is driven by his positive emotions and, because he has hope in his heart that he can "save the day and get the girl," he decides to do what he can to make the ride as comfortable for the rest of us as he possibly can, even at the cost of his own life. But The Joker sees things differently. He is, if not more so, just as intelligent as the Batman. He understands that at least for him, there is nothing to be enjoyed in life. Selfishly he decides that he must drag everyone else down with him. It's easy to catch the symbolism here, as it's almost literal (and it somehow harks back to the Green Lantern mythos, though I am unsure of whether this is deliberate): Harvey is the side of a man that represents positivity - hope, compassion, and love, which combine to form "Order." Bruce represents balance between all emotions, with a central focus on will. The Joker represents negativity - fear, avarice and rage, which combine to form "Chaos." Later in the Dark Knight Trilogy a fourth personality is introduced, but that is not what we are discussing here. The beginning is quite literally the chaotic personality's entry into the world, taking advantage of everything that he can in order to do... nothing in particular. That's what's so excellent about this story! The goons would be his friends in the real life interpretation of it, and when he kills them or has them turn on each other, this is the loss that happens when you "turn to the dark side," or choose to give up on the world, as The Joker has done. But enough metaphorical interpretation, let's talk about the literal aspects of the film. The first noticeable thing to me was not the direction, the acting, the cinematography nor the editing or action sequences, but Hans Zimmer's score for the film, which was at first deliberately disgusting, with the use of what sounds like a wire being strung for eternity, abused violins and electric guitar, but ultimately beautiful, with the most moving piece of music heard in "Like A Dog Chasing Cars" since Krypton's theme in Superman by John Williams, and until "Time" from Inception - yet another Zimmer theme! Mocked as it may be, his dense string ostinato sequences left me breathless. But back to the story, I'm going to skip a huge chunk and get right to the meaty part. I wish I could cue Zimmer's "Horn of Doom" here to alert you to the impending spoiler. Don't read if you haven't watched the movie! Rachel is indirectly killed by Joker. While he is being interrogated, the timer ticks down to the explosion of two buildings, each with one hostage inside: Gotham's White Knight, and Harvey and Bruce's only known love. Here is the great metaphor of the entire trilogy: Hope. Moving on. Loving more than just one - something both Harvey and Batman are, at the moment, incapable of doing. The Joker takes advantage of Rachel's death and Harvey's disfigurement (as you may remember, half of his face is burned off in the fire of the explosion), and convinces him to embrace the chaos of the world around him, and essentially, give in to evil. He accepts this offer. Skipping ahead to the final acts of this movie (and it has oh so many), we have The Joker about to kill dozens if not hundreds of people on a couple of ferries, who represent the good and bad sides of society, and Harvey, the hero, twisted into wanting vengeance on Commissioner Gordon. Once again I will take a break from the story. Let's talk about the other aspects. Is this movie effects-heavy? Surprisingly, no. You'd think it would be, given that, it's Batman. But in fact, it relies on practical effects more than anything else. For example, when the massive truck that the Joker is in gets flipped, it is not done with CGI, but with a spring of all things, that shoots it upwards. I won't even say anything about the acting - I want you to watch it, because in all honesty, words could not do it justice. In my mortal explanation of one of the various metaphors presented by this film (and believe me, there are other ways to interpret it - mine is just the most literal, emotional example), I have butchered Mr. Nolan's work, so I will just say that you MUST keep an eye on Heath Ledger. THE VERDICT: Direction: 9.5 Acting: 10.0 Cinematography: 9.0 Editing: 9.0 Soundtrack: 10.0 Overall: 9.75
9	I prefer the the 1989 film for its comic book dark stile, but I watched it again and it's like a crime action drama. So the film is fantastic and awesome like the original, so yeah, I love this movie for doing some thing different and succeeding:)
10	This is my #1 movie. Ever since i saw it in theatres i've seen it over 80000000 times. I know every line from this great film. From the acting to the story this movie is solid, thought provoking and totally awesome.
10	Pulp has never been so artistic. Chris Nolan's neo-shakespearean magnum opus soars across the cinema hall, proving to the world that sometimes even comic-book adaptations can be worthy of novelistic ambition. This haunted and poetic Batman diegesis deals with dark thematic issues most movie never touch, like the West's responsibility for terrorism, deceiving the masses for their own good, love not saving anyone and the impossibility of living up to heroic expectations. The Dark Knight meditates on the significance of morality, the imperfection of fortitude, the justice in anarchy and the corruptibility of humanity. Nolan wants us to believe in the darkness within each of us, the mask we all wear, to hide our two-facedness. The Dark Knight touches on these themes boldly and bravely, not ashamed of the fact the the lead character is a man dressing up like a Bat. How long has it been since we've seen a blockbuster that's so thought provoking? Not since Apocalypse Now, I would say. The sign of a great film is if it's impact lasts longer than its screen-time, and the Dark Knight lingers long after the credits have rolled. It leaves us reflecting on its striking perspicuous similarities to our own post 9/11 world and makes us wonder if nature in it's most elementary form is governed by chaos and the structures we've erected just create an illusion of harmony (or is it the other way around?).
10	The Dark Knight is the superior Batman. This is what 1989 Batman should have been.Smart writing, smart direction, and incredible action sequences. Heath Ledger is the true Joker.
10	This Film is great,Christopher Nolan really knows who is Batman he made this movie one of the best films of all time.The Dark Knight has a good plot a great villain and a good musical score(Hans Zimmer).
10	Probably one of the best films you will watch today. As Christopher Nolan really pushed the boundaries with this flawless action crime drama. Batman has to deal with many familiar faces and doesn't disappoint with good acting brilliant action and a nice musical score.
10	So i thought the first film was pretty boring. Definitely not the case with this one. It's gritty, it's dark, brings brilliant character development along with far more interesting characters like The Joker and Two-face, and has the best plot out of all 3 films. A performance best by the sadly late Heath Ledger as the Joker, and Aaron Eckart and Christian Bale also bringing excellent performances. This film has a far more film noir feel to it (but obviously isn't film noir). Thr twists are brilliant and Ledgers transformation into the Joker is the best on screen performance to dub our screens yet. Film is filled with great visual effects also, awesome practical effects and great stunts too! A must watch!
10	The Dark Knight that came out in 2008 starring Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Maggie Gyllenhaal is a superhero movie of Batman. When Batman, Gordon and Harvey Dent tries bring down the mob, they face a new threat The Joker, who raises hell in Gotham. What unfolds is a 150 min of high pace crime thriller. The story is quite dark, complex and engaging. The cast is just amazing. Heath Ledger gave legendary outstanding performance in his last role. His each dialogue is just amazing. I kinda love every sec he is in on the screen. The Joker can be considered one of the best villains of all time. Christian Bale is amazing in his best role of Batman. Though not as screen time as he had in the last movie (Batman Begins), but still he gave an amazing performance. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent was quite good. After Joker, Harvey had 2nd best dialogues of the movie. Pacing of the movie is awesome too. There won't be any part of the movie which feels slow or boring, mainly because every conversation is important. Action is kinda different and unique making it amazing . Overall The Dark knight is an OUTSTANDING movie. Plot:10/10 Dialogue:10/10 Acting:10/10 Action:10/10 Pace:10/10 Overall:10/10
8	I'm surprised this movie gets bashed as much as it does/did. Not only does this movie have a great story, (Which was made by DC Comics,) but it also has great humor within, the Joker who is Batman's enemy, which you probably already know. Although some parts do get a little boring.
8	The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan. Based on the DC Comics character Batman, the film is the second part of Nolan's Batman film series and a sequel to 2005's Batman Begins. Christian Bale reprises the lead role of Bruce Wayne/Batman, with a returning cast of Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as James Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox. The film introduces the character of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham's newly elected District Attorney and the consort of Bruce Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal replacing Katie Holmes from the first film), who joins Batman and the police in combating the new rising threat of a criminal mastermind calling himself "The Joker" (Heath Ledger).
10	Simply one of the best superhero movies of all time! This movie not only has everything a Batman movie should have it has everything you look for in any movie! Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is jaw dropping and will give you chills! A+ 10 out of 10
9	Though not as good as the first, The Dark Knight lives up to its legendary title and is good as you could possibly get with a Batman Begins sequel. A great casting choice for Joker makes the movie all the more worthwhile.
8	Unlike the first movie in the trilogy Batman Begins this one is actually pretty good. Great acting, great story. Batman's (Christian Bale) voice was kinda annoying. I have to say Heath Ledger really did an excellent job portraying Joker.
10	Pulp has never been so artistic. Chris Nolan's neo-shakespearean magnum opus soars across the cinema hall, proving to the world that sometimes even comic-book adaptations can be worthy of novelistic ambition. Despite being a blockbuster, the Dark Knight deals with dark thematic issues most movie never touch like - the road to fascism is paved with good intentions, idealism is always easier to corrupt than greed, light always coexists with darkness (or as the Joker would say freaks attract freaks) and perhaps most disturbing of all, the Dark Knight proclaims that in a world where there is no justice there's no way to fight the system without falling into corruption, apathy or worse. Nolan wants us to take a good long look at the brutally bleak streets of Gotham and reflect on its striking perspicuous similarities to our own post 9/11 world. It makes us wonder if nature in it's most elementary form is governed by chaos and the structures we've erected just create an illusion of harmony (or is it the other way around?).
10	This is my favourite movie of all time. It's dark, awesome and has one of the best villain performances of all time, R.I.P Heath Ledger. Also I love Batman,he is my favourite comic book character. 10/10
10	I cannot deny this is a superior superhero film. Or just a superior film. I'm not a Batman fan (I used to hate the guy) but I've always liked "The Dark Knight". I will say that some things, as usual in this trilogy, are a bit exaggerated, but if you overlook these few things, you'll find this movie to be thrilling, exciting, touching and freaking cool. This will be repeated to death, but the big highlight is obviously Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker. Lastly, a dark tone will always suit a character like Batman in such a good way, that you'll barely believe it.
10	There is so many good things that I could say about this movie. Aside from the brilliant acting, fantastic score, and amazing directing, the thing that Dark Knight does really well is the plot and development of the characters. Let's face it. A majority of super hero movies are terrible. But this film not only manages to be a good super hero movie, but a great movie in general. The characters are realistic and relatable. The villains have a clear purpose and goal. Everything about this movie is perfect. A must watch for any film fan!
0	Il peggior Joker che abbia mai visto, niente a che spartire con Jack Nicholson, e poi vogliamo parlare di Due Facce? Un personaggio buttato lÃ¬ solo per riempire una mezz'oretta di film in piÃ¹
9	Even though its plot isn't perfect, The Dark Knight succeeds due to gritty, well-made action sequences, strong performances from every cast member (especially Heath Ledger as the Joker), and an overall unique and dark take on the story of Batman. While it isn't entirely deserving of a perfect score, it comes extremely close. 9.9/10
0	most overrated movie i've ever seen in entire my life. it's not even close to classic movies such as the godfather, the lord of the rings, casablanca, citizen kane and etc.
10	The one singular thing I loved more than anything abotu this film was Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker. The one thing that touches me about his performance is that he was so into his character, he couldn't get out, and so he became The Joker. He WAS the best Joker I've ever seen. This film, all in all, was a great second chapter to the trilogy!
10	A genuine crime epic that fits into the Batman mythos with ease and certainty. Obviously there are a few problems with the film, but that goes for every other movie. The pros easily outweigh the cons in this case. The film is beautifully shot, the action scenes are viscerally thrilling, and it never ceases to be thought-provoking. Everybody involved in the production seemed to have given everything they had to make the best film they could make, and they came very, very close. The screenplay is sound, structure-wise, and it's impressive how the film seems epic in scope, yet maintains a level of palpable intimacy. One of the best films ever made.
10	I love Batman because the story of his plight is more than about good guys vs bad guys. It's also about doing what is best for everyone and it explores the realities of problems in society. That movie to world connection really captivates me because every character seems to symbolize something. If you haven't seen this, you're missing out the best superhero film right now in the past two decades. Everyone raves about Christopher Nolan but his innovative storytelling really sets this movie apart. The fight scenes are good, the MUSIC complements this well like ketchup and mustard, and the scenes contributing to the plot are all very good. What I really liked was the boldness to go dark in a superhero movie. That was definitely a shocker at the time, but it has been triumphant because of the emotional performance by all the actors in the movie. 10s are very hard to come by and to all the haters, I can't think of any superhero movie or action film that tops this. I guess every man is entitled to their opinion. Overall, do yourself a big favor if you have not seen this and set aside an entire evening served with good food and drinks to watch this film. The performances are extremely memorable and it sure ain't basic. Word to describe: sympathy, you will feel empathy for both protagonists and antagonists...a good thing all movies have but it ain't Stockholm Syndrome level. This is a fine movie to watch alone or with a few friends but don't make this a big hoorah and definitely DO NOT invite the annoying friend. He/She will ruin everything you planned for that time. Set aside a different time to catchup with that person.
9	8.8/10................................................................................................................................................
10	First of all, there is no doubt that the reputation of this film, and Heath Ledger's performance, were bolstered by his untimely death. That makes no difference. This is an accomplished and subversive work, and the most fully realised of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy - its predecessor did little more than establish the foundations of this film, whilst its successor lacked focus or a satisfying conclusion. "The Dark Knight", on the other hand, is an expansive, complex and soulful masterpiece of film, which spearheaded the re-evaluation and acknowledgement of the superhero genre as an art form capable of producing stories as daring, layered and emotive as standard art house fare, or modernist literature and being good for more than just action and special effects. This film is masterfully designed, scored, edited, acted, and shot, reminiscent both stylistically and in terms of storytelling as the classic thrillers of the 1970s. Much like New York City in "Taxi Driver", Nolan's Gotham breathes, and so do the characters, who are understood as real people and compelled to act as such, rather than just vehicles transporting the viewer from one action set piece to the next. Both Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart are fantastic, offering nuanced and desperate portraits of virtuous men broken by their own goodness. They deserved Oscar nominations as much as Heath Ledger. As for Heath Ledger, it is an astonishing piece of acting whether he lived to see it on-screen or not. He is explosive, twisted, visceral, and utterly terrifying - and damn near impossible to take your eyes off of. Is this is a perfect film? There's one too many leaps of logic involved, so it falls short, but only by a minuscule margin. This is certainly one of the best films I've seen - a grand and operatic morality play, breathtakingly colossal, searingly intimate, and unbearably sad. Detractors may try to use Heath Ledger's death to discredit its success as circumstantial. I remind you: nobody from "The Avengers" died.
10	A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects create a truly realistic experience.
10	This is the best batman movie ever. Great cinematography. Great acting. Awesome story. First scene in imax will blow you away. Great ending. I highly recommend owning this flick on blu ray
10	It isn't an overstatement to call The Dark Knight the most sophisticated and ambitious work of its kind. Superior to all three Spider-Man installments and even its amazing predecessor in terms of conceptualization, writing, acting, and direction, Nolan's follow-up to Batman Begins is a dark, complex and disturbing film, not the least of which because it grafts its heroics onto the blueprint of actual reality rather than that of spandex-clad supermen. And while such a distinction may make little difference to those already eagerly anticipating the return of the caped crusader, suffice it to say that The Dark Knight qualifies as the first official comic book adaptation that truly succeeds in being a great artistic achievement in its own right.
10	Not only the best superhero movie ever but one of the best movies ever.It is a masterpiece in every right.Everybody does a great job at acting especially Heath as The Joker who for me is the best acting role in movie history.It's dark,thrilling and very unforgettable,and that's exactly what u need in a movie like this.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors working today and He doesn't need an Oscar to prove it nor does this movie need a Best Picture to prove it's by far the best 2000s movie if not much more.This definitely made history and people who say this is a bad movie have no idea what movies should be.I just can not understand people who say that this is a bad film.I'm seeing here 216 Negative reviews and it's unbelievable,who can people not enjoy this great film.This is how films should be and must be.I totally prefer this over Comedic Superhero films like those that Marvel keeps putting on the big screen.It's clear that those are made for a far younger audience.In the end of this review The Dark Knight at least to me is by far the best movie ever and one that I'll remember until I die.
9	A good film critic, a really good film critic, is a film critic that you can trust to be the film critic you need and not just the film critic you want. It would be easy, quite easy, to get swept up in the media masses who are desperately pining for "The Dark Knight," Heath Ledger's cinematic swan song and Christopher Nolan's second "Batman" film, to be a slice of cinematic paradise worthy of all the pre-opening Oscar surrounding Ledger's turn as The Joker. The good news is that the awards hype is warranted...Heath Ledger doesn't so much burst from Jack Nicholson's shadow as he simply and beautifully and maniacally reinvents The Joker as a psychologically tortured criminal that is society's most dangerous type of criminal...the type of criminal who makes you compromise your own values in order to even have a hope of catching him. Ledger's performance is a little bit prancing and preening, a whole lot menacing and taunting. Ledger would have undoubtedly cast himself into the Hollywood stratosphere with this performance, especially coming on the heels of such diverse work as "Brokeback Mountain," "Casanova" and "I'm Not There." The simple fact that Ledger can, unbelievably, make you forget his tragic death with this performance is even more haunting as you leave the theatre and reflect on the performance. In other words, an Oscar nomination is a given. An Oscar award, while a bit more of a stretch, is certainly not out of the realm of possibility. Yes, Ledger really is that good in "The Dark Knight." Indeed, Nolan's second visit to Gotham is as intense, exhilarating and intelligent as his first with "Batman Begins." "The Dark Knight" is even more relentless in the psychological warfare that is unleashed before your very eyes. Nolan's "The Dark Knight" isn't the fantasy world of so many superhero flicks, rather it is a startlingly realistic and uncomfortably authentic Gotham that sets Batman (Christian Bale), The Joker, Gordon (Gary Oldman, Scarecrow Cillian Murphy) and Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal) in OUR world. This is a Gotham that could just as easily be a Chicago (where much of it was filmed), New York, Los Angeles or Indianapolis. Nolan's Gotham is a world not unlike our own, a world in which the righteous and the evildoer are easily confused and, ultimately, all are disposable. It is a world that requires a superhero that transcends it all to become the superhero that is needed not just wanted. It is a world that needs not just a "white knight," the label given the new do-gooder District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), but a dark knight willing to do whatever it takes to save the community. It would be a foolish and critical mistake to fault Nolan for this dark vision. With "The Dark Knight," Nolan does not always make the popular decision nor the comfortable decision. Instead, indeed, Nolan becomes the filmmaker "The Dark Knight" needs him to be by avoiding a reliance on the romantic conflicts of "Super-Man" and the more audience-friendly lightness of the recent "Iron Man." "The Dark Knight" is intense, morbid, uncomfortable and exhausting. It is as much an action film as it is a superhero film, if not even moreso. It doesn't aim to please, it aims to envelope the senses and even one's sense of being. "The Dark Knight" succeeds. From the opening moments of a perfectly choreographed bank robbery, Nolan makes it completely apparent that "The Dark Knight," especially in its preferred IMAX format, is going to plop right down in our laps and rattle every cell of our bodies until we're pleading for a mercy that never arrives until the closing credits. Christian Bale feels even more comfortable as the caped crusader, with a performance that is even more focused and precise than his turn in "Batman Begins." As chiseled as his abs, Bale turns Batman and Bruce Wayne into characters disturb because they leave you thinking that you really ought to be a better human being yourself. While I'm still not sold on the digitally manipulated vocals for Batman, Bale's presence is as maniacal as Ledger's without ever giving into The Joker's chaos. The film's supporting players are uniformly strong, most notably Aaron Eckhart's quieter yet equally career-transcending turn as Dent, who experiences an unexpected tragedy that transforms him into his already assigned nickname of Harvey Two-Face. It was Eckhart's casting that, for some reason, made the least sense to me and the early trailer's hadn't put me at ease. Yet, within the first few minutes of "The Dark Knight," Eckhart removes all doubts with a performance that is moving and scary and frighteningly real. Both of Batman's confidante's return, Pennyworth (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). Pennyworth harbors a secret that could potentially change everything, while Lucius becomes Batman's conscience when even he becomes ever so slightly consumed by the power he possesses. Both actors bring their A-game to the proceedings, turning what many films would project as minor characters into essential players. Gary Oldman, as well, deliciously underplays Gordon and proves a nice contrast to the chaos that surrounds him and, perhaps most notably, Nolan corrects the miscasting of Katie Holmes in "Batman Begins" by adding the weightier Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, the woman who is in the midst Dent and Wayne and Batman. Co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan, "The Dark Knight" often seems to be as chaotic as the world in which The Joker lives. The script infuses The Joker with the film's greatest lines, lines such as "What doesn't kill you makes you stranger" and a well-placed, cinematic flashback will haunt you long after the closing credits. Yet, the script is far greater than the sum of its parts with little bits and pieces that will permeate your brain even moreso after you leave, as an effective script should. As all-enveloping as "The Dark Knight" is, it is not without its flaws and, depending upon your cinematic preferences, these flaws may impact your view of the film even moreso than it did mine. As beautifully choreographed as was the opening bank robbery, there are at least a couple of occasions where Nolan struggles to make sense of action sequences that are NOT choreographed with any sense of style or purpose or clarity. It feels unintentional and, fortunately, Nolan keeps the proceedings moving so quickly that it's easy to be so swept up in the action that one barely notices. Still, I noticed. Similarly, on occasion, the special effects seemed a tad run-of-the-mill. Most notably, an extended sequence involving a city-wide sonar device felt like it was more out of "Wargames" than Gotham and lacked the rest of the film's exhilarating sense of awesomeness. "The Dark Knight," while certainly not a graphic film in terms of violence, is nonetheless a graphic film in terms of its psychological warfare. Ledger's The Joker means business and, coupled with Nolan's relentless intentionality, "The Dark Knight" may not be a film for smaller children unable to fully process this darker, morbid Gotham. There are moments, quite a few moments, in "The Dark Knight" that transcend anything you've seen in any other superhero film. It is a feral beast of a film that will impact you like it impacted me, waking me up at 4am to write a review of a film I simply cannot stop thinking about for even a moment. Brooding, captivating, unforgettable and awesome, "The Dark Knight" isn't always the film you want it to be...instead, Nolan compels us into a world that is equal parts fantasy and disturbing reality. "The Dark Knight" is the film we need it to be.
9	Batman (Bale) hopes to hang up his cape and hand over crime-fighting duties to District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). But the arrival of clown-faced master criminal The Joker (Ledger) forces the masked vigilante to question everything he stands for. Nolan navigates through a moral maze and some pointed politicking, but without ever stinting on stunts or explosions. It is thoughtful but never dull, and the OTT action and expansion â€” underscored in IMAX sequences which will no doubt look spectacular on the enormo-screen (Empire reviewed from a 35mm print) â€” are generally to its benefit, even though Nolan still appears more comfortable and engaged with interacting people than trucks and Batbikes. After a blistering opening, thereâ€™s a second act lull and a story shift not quite as elegant (or, some might argue, even coherent) as youâ€™d expect from the director of The Prestige. But The Dark Knight is spectacular, visionary blockbuster entertainment: pretty much everything you could hope for and then some. It isnâ€™t perfect but then, like its hero, like his late co-star, and as Nolanâ€™s fitting tribute so ably observes, nobody is. Ledgerâ€™s performance is monumental, but The Dark Knight lives up to it. Nolan cements his position as Hollywoodâ€™s premier purveyor of blockbuster smarts â€“ and the Batbike is kinda cool, too.
9	Consequences. In real life, these ramifications emanate from every action like ripples from a stone thrown into a pond. Often in movies, especially those that feature characters who don't play by the rules, such penalties are suspended. However, in Christopher Nolan's Batman universe, decisions and actions have consequences. The Dark Knight, arguably the moodiest and most adult superhero motion picture ever to reach the screen, illustrates this lesson in ways that are startling and painful. This is a tough, uncompromising motion picture - one that defies the common notions of what is expected from a "superhero" film. While there are plenty of action sequences and instances of derring-do, The Dark Knight's subtext has a tragic underpinning that would intrigue Shakespeare or the Greeks. It's about power and impotence, sanity and madness, image and reality, selfishness and sacrifice, and - yes - consequences. It has often been said that Tim Burton's vision of Batman was the darkest representation we were ever likely to see of a superhero. Compared to how Nolan sees the character, Burton's version was a pantomime. For many long-running franchises, Burton's included, the second volume stands tallest. Nolan has followed up on his gritty and successful Batman Begins with one of the best all-time sequels, and perhaps the most impressive mainstream entertainment experience since 2003's The Return of the King. The Dark Knight builds upon the themes and premises founded three years ago. With the introductions and origins dispensed with in Batman Begins, Nolan uses this opportunity to expand upon his portrait of Batman as a haunted individual who, driven by forces rooted deep in his psyche, must dispense justice according to his own strict code. Often in superhero movies, there's a sense that, no matter what challenges the protagonist must face, all will be right in the end. That certainty is missing here, and its absence may represent Nolan's most impressive accomplishment. Batman is fallible and his world is dangerous. No character, no matter how well-established in Batman lore, is safe. This director's Gotham City may be less garish and gothic than Burton's, but it is in many ways a bleaker and more oppressive place. It's a joyless venue and the hero takes his demeanor from his city. Batman is a grim, brooding superhero. He rarely speaks while in costume and, when he does, his voice quivers with menace and his words are devoid of the quips and one-liners audiences have come to associate with action heroes. For all of the heavy lifting done by the movie's screenplay, dealing as it does with substantive issues and existential questions, there's still plenty of the meat-and-potatoes content of any superhero movie: action sequences. There are numerous fights, chases, and races. The Batmobile gets its share of screen time as does a new Bat-cycle. Batman takes on bad guys singly and in bunches. And there's a heart-pounding sequence in which the Caped Crusader must race against time to save a life, where the price is almost as terrible if he succeeds as if he fails. Nolan's inherent sense of how to transform a relatively mundane fight scene into something involving is in evidence here, much as was the case in Batman Begins. He avoids flash editing and allows the action to evolve in a coherent manner, drawing the viewer in rather than keeping him guessing what's going on. 2008 may be the year that the superhero movie comes of age. Iron Man represents the best screen adventure of a Marvel hero. Now, D.C. has answered with The Dark Knight, a film so impressive in every significant facet that it makes one wonder why it took so long for the genre to reach this high level. Christopher Nolan has provided movie-goers with the best superhero movie to-date, outclassing previous titles both mediocre and excellent, and giving this franchise its The Empire Strikes Back.
10	once again Nolan does the impossible! arguably the best of the series! fantastic movie from all involved! what a monumental achievement! best comic book film!

He rarely speaks while in costume and, when he does, his voice quivers with menace and his words are devoid of the quips and one-liners audiences have come to associate with action heroes. Of the newcomers, the Joker is the biggest addition. One could argue that it's impossible to make a Batman series without facing the main character against the Joker at some point. No superhero and villain are more inextricably linked. Yet this Joker is unlike any we have previously encountered. Cesar Romero's interpretation of the character (in the '60s TV series) was that of a deadly prankster. Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance made 1989's Batman all about the bad guy. The late Heath Ledger, however, gives us something darker and more twisted - a role that would have been no less memorable had it not been his last and most grueling. There's nothing humorous about this freak. No flowery lines like "You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?" This is no caricature - The Joker is a frighteningly vicious and intelligent monster who represents a legitimate match for the title character. The other major character to join the ensemble is Aaron Eckhart as Gotham's charismatic, photogenic D.A. Harvey Dent is Gotham's Knight in Shining Armor, and that's how Eckhart plays him - an individual with a pure heart who makes his own luck. Those even passingly familiar with Batman lore know Dent's fate, and it plays out here as one might suspect, although Nolan puts a different spin on things than did Joel Schumacher. For all of the heavy lifting done by the movie's screenplay, dealing as it does with substantive issues and existential questions, there's still plenty of the meat-and-potatoes content of any superhero movie: action sequences.

Of the newcomers, the Joker is the biggest addition. One could argue that it's impossible to make a Batman series without facing the main character against the Joker at some point. No superhero and villain are more inextricably linked. Yet this Joker is unlike any we have previously encountered. Cesar Romero's interpretation of the character (in the '60s TV series) was that of a deadly prankster. Jack Nicholson's over-the-top performance made 1989's Batman all about the bad guy. The late Heath Ledger, however, gives us something darker and more twisted - a role that would have been no less memorable had it not been his last and most grueling. There's nothing humorous about this freak. No flowery lines like "You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?" This is no caricature - The Joker is a frighteningly vicious and intelligent monster who represents a legitimate match for the title character. For all of the heavy lifting done by the movie's screenplay, dealing as it does with substantive issues and existential questions, there's still plenty of the meat-and-potatoes content of any superhero movie: action sequences. There are numerous fights, chases, and races. The Batmobile gets its share of screen time as does a new Bat-cycle. Batman takes on bad guys singly and in bunches. And there's a heart-pounding sequence in which the Caped Crusader must race against time to save a life, where the price is almost as terrible if he succeeds as if he fails. Nolan's inherent sense of how to transform a relatively mundane fight scene into something involving is in evidence here, much as was the case in Batman Begins. He avoids flash editing and allows the action to evolve in a coherent manner, drawing the viewer in rather than keeping him guessing what's going on. 2008 may be the year that the superhero movie comes of age. Iron Man represents the best screen adventure of a Marvel hero. Now, D.C. has answered with The Dark Knight, a film so impressive in every significant facet that it makes one wonder why it took so long for the genre to reach this high level. Christopher Nolan has provided movie-goers with the best superhero movie to-date, outclassing previous titles both mediocre and excellent, and giving this franchise its The Empire Strikes Back.
10	The best villain action of all time is in this movie, also a movie that revolutionized its genre and a terrific wonderful script and direction from Christopher Nolan. WATCH AND LOVE IT!
8	One of the best movies out there. A superhero movie that doesn't feel like superhero movie. The problem with this movie for me is the fighting scenes and its heaviness.
9	Great, serious and realistic film like Batman Begins, great acting of the cast, good action scenes, interesting and engaging story, well worth watching.
9	Simply fantastic! It's my favorite super hero movie and one of my favorite movies! Why? Well ,it's just so well written, with dark humor, intense action, a menacing villain, etc. There are so many memorable moments (the bank robbery, the "you know how I got these scars?" speeches, etc.) and lines ("Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...stranger." -Joker, "Do you know how I got these scars?"-Joker "No, but I know how you got these." -Batman, etc.) I could go on forever about my love for this movie, but I have to admit that there are some kind of dull parts that could have been shorter or mixed with less dull material... or something. That's why it's not a ten. Aside form it being a little dull here or there, it's the perfect dark super hero movie and just an all-around outstanding film!
9	Amazing! this movie brings a whole new life into Batman, and changed how a "superhero" movie had to be. Heath Ledger was absolutely fantastic and i think his performance was the best solo acting performance to date. He not only looked the part extremely well, but he became the joker and brought it to another level. The story was great and it really showed the difference batman had between battling other enemies and battling the joker. It was no longer a physical challenge, but a mental and moral struggle. The joker made batman make the decision to give up being batman, in order to defeat the joker and save Harvey's legacy. It also brought a more realistic and gritty feel that really digs deep into the moral values of the characters.
8	I'm not the biggest Batman fan. He's probably one of the worst Justice League heroes FOR ME. But this movie is without any doubt a masterpiece! Excelent acting, great story and visual effects. If you like DC, watch it!
9	Del toro and Perlman bring hellboy to life with a heart and a sense of humor that is unique and remarkably engaging. This is an exceptional popcorn movie.
10	Do not be fooled by critics. This movie serves up its goods on a big plate of FUN with a big heaping side of cinematic GREATNESS. If you are a student and fan of film, go see this.
9	One of the best transitions to screen from comic I've seen in a while, especially cause hellboy is one of the smarter comics out there. This makes up for The Hulk, Daredevil and LXG movies being such let downs, especially since LXG and Daredevil are two of my favorite comics. I knew Mignola wouldn't let it suck.
7	A well-made Comic Book movie, Perlman and Bliar are great, some of the action gets a little tiring but still, nicely made.
5	I was so looking forward to this movie, but alas it didn't live up to expectations. The movie seemed to be missing something. This so-called hero had no real power other than brute strength. He needed guns, grenades, and another character to save the day. Nothing too special, hopefully the Punisher will be better.
9	An excellent movie, well worth paying full price to see. It's fun, it's beautifully filmed, it's funny ... what more could you ask for?
7	This was a very enjoyable film and should spawn a sequel or two. The only question is, since this is one of those "save the world" films, what do you do for an encore? Ron Perlman was excellent as the blue collar hero. But rather than be a simple caricature, we saw Hellboy's deep feelings emerge for one of his fellow teammates, whose powers resemble those of an X-Men 2 mutant. The scene with him spying on her from a rooftop while she was on a date was really funny and somewhat tender at the same time. The mysterious Nazi in the "gas mask" is revealed eventually and he slices and dices his way through the film like a martial arts expect with nunchak-like steel blades. The CGI monster looks like a cross between a squid, a warthog and a wolf. There's proof that this film doesn't try to take itself too seriously when Hellboy battles one of these creatures with one hand while holding onto a box of kittens in the other. The comment he makes will crack you up. At times, the story is a bit convuluted and would require a second viewing to follow closely. Hellboy is a new cinema icon and so long as Perlman is able to play the role with humour and human feelings, much like Tobey McGuire's Spiderman, we have the makings of a franchise. It's not as superb as the last X-Men film but Hellboy the chracter is much more charismatic that the Hulk, Daredevil or any of the cast from The Leagure of Extraordinarly Gentlemen. Review by Triniman
2	I'm probably not the best critic out there, but from my honest opinion, this is the worst movie of the year. Action was mediocre at best and cinematics was okay. Nothing great, nothing special. Hope you don't waste your money and time like I did.
6	A fun visual ride with action and humor, that's about it. Story is somewhat weak and at times hoaky. Although it's 2 hours long, it feels longer, and even with the length, character development gets lost in the effects and action. You just really didn't care about anyone in the end... not even the lame backend love story. Still, not a bad comic book film.
7	Very entertaining. Seamless integration of animation and live action. Truly horrific creatures made watchable by adding a hefty pinch of tongue-in-cheek. WAY too much dialogue, though, and a few glitches suggestive of hurried post-prod (is there coffee in them cups? What happened to the FBI chief?).
9	The 60 million dollar budget is so well used it looks like it was done on double that. Every character was perfectly cast, and well acted all around. The story is a bit light but enjoyable, and the action scenes are amazing. All around I give it a 9. 10 if there was more Abe.
9	I saw the movie tonight and it was great!. The story is good and special effects are amazing. I recomend u to see it. This is a kind of movie to watch in theather, not by dvd or tv.
7	I was so fired up to see this film, and it is good, but it could have been so much better. Perlman is awesome, but you never get a tangible feel for the bad guys, what they want, and how Hellboy is vulnerable, etc. I would like to see them work it out in a sequel, though. Good, though limited, showcase for Selma Blair, by the way (if there are any closet SB fans out there).
4	Despite the high marks, Hellboy is full of plotholes from the first frame to the last. The only performance that makes this film watchable is that of Ron Perlman, who quite possibly is the first genre actor who might deserve some acting accolades for playing tortured men under makeup.
8	An enjoyable adventure flick. Not perfect, but definitely the most entertaining theatre excursion so far this year.
8	An enjoyable adventure flick. Not perfect, but definitely the most entertaining theatre excursion so far this year.
7	Ron Perlman was PERFECT as Hellboy. Aside from the lead role, not much was noteworthy. The plot wasn't hard to follow, it was just unclear, and therefore unengaging. Selma Blair did a good job, and there are a few memorable scenes. All in all, worth seeing for entertainment value.
8	I personally thought this movie was great. It had good special effects and Ron Perlman did great as Hellboy. Way way better than the pathetic Home on The Range.
7	Taken at face value, the movie, as a SciFi, was okay. But I can?t help wondering how perverse we, as a society, have become when we ridicule someone for making a movie about The Christ, yet raise no objections to a movie where the main character is drawn off of the theological concept of Satan. Even Satan?s angelic name is used in the movie (incorrectly, I might add). Verbal Kint (a.k.a., Keiser Soze) was right - The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. I can?t help feel like I should have gone and seen the Passion?
6	This is a marginally entertaining comic book yarn. There are a number of cute or clever lines of dialogue and site gags. There is also a decent heart at the center of the film. Most of the special effects are decent, though a few of the more elaborate finale sequences look very computer generated. An entertaining, albeit flawed, film. Not really for "action" junkies, because of the cartoonish nature of the violence. I had a good time though.
8	Surprisingly good! let me level with ya - i DON'T MIND FX movies! as a sci fi, fantasy (and FX) fan, i don't mind dumb, loud, bad movies with lots of pretty, shiny sparkles. see cool stuff go boom, eat some popcorn, it's all good. heck, a lot better than a bad drama which is truly irredeemable. and my expectations for hellboy rose no further than just such fx films... especially considering del toro's past work (cough blade 2 cough). but i was truly surprised at what a GENUINELY GOOD MOVIE it is! wow... i don't think i've seen such a 'character driven' fx movie in a loooooong time. whereas other fx movies blow their wad on the fx and overblown action sequences (cough reloaded cough), this movie's action sequences are pulled back nearly to the bare minimum - although not enough to disappoint a one like me - and the time is instead devoted to charming little set pieces like HB spying on his girl and getting love advice from a nine year old. even the climax battle is remarkably and refreshingly spare. of course, one does have the sneaking suspicion that the choices of scenes was influenced greatly by BUDGET... but if that's the case, let's hope more action films get 'hamstrung' by budgetary limitations. the exposition is also handled in a highly efficient and offbeat manner (unlike the horrid batman movies where one boring character after another has to have their origin story play out en toto) - on the run, as it were - and the narrative weaves and dodges in ways that you wouldn't expect. good for del toro! it's good to see both del toro and jackson grow from cheap kinetics to a more grounded and mature aesthetic in their most recent film. all the characters are drawn quickly, sharply and with great affection. even the villains exude an easy charisma and are, in their way, extremely likable. the monsters are well designed and exhibit a lovecraftian influence. unfortunately, because the story does not let you in on it, this visual reference to lovecraft is all the backstory you get on what the motivations of these creatures might be. if you don't get from their appearance alone that these 'elder ones' are primordial evils that seek the very undoing of the fabric of our universe, then you may indeed be puzzled as to what exactly they might be up to. while the budget may have played a part in determining WHAT got on screen, it does not show at all in the WAY IT GOT THERE! the fx are fantastic and the makeup work is great... some really really good interchanges between live action/make up and cgi... nice work. perlman deserves much more credit than he gets and i hope that this film elevates him to more roles... perhaps some that don't require a 3am call time and four hours in the makeup chair. anyhoo, just like hellboy himself, the movie may appear on the surface to be a known and predictable quantity. but like it's namesake, it turns out to be something altogether unexpected and, especially given the name, remarkably 'pure at heart'. jin
9	An early front-runner for popcorn flick of the year, this comic book adaptation is everything it shoud be: stylish, irreverant, witty and exciting. The great director, Del Toro, lets the story steer the special effects and not vice-versa, and this is Ron Perlman's best role since Beauty and the Beast.
7	Pretty good, but WAY too many corny jokes.
9	Very awesome. Funny when it needs to be, action packed, a very cool flick.
6	It was cool, but just had some layers to it that kept it from reaching a for sure "good" status, in my mind anyway. Hellboy's portrayal from Perlman is very entertaining and makes the big red dude with a stone hand quite believable. The effects are very nice, and the scenes are definitely entertaining. I felt like the movie started off with amazing potential but then kind of fizzled along the way into mediocrity. It's definitely entertaining, regardless. But as far as the love elements and villain go i could care less for the both of them. I knew I might have been in for a good movie marred by its less than...flattering elements right when i saw a scientist start feeding a devil baby candy bars as it roams around looking like a Shrek extra reject.
7	Worked when ever it was soley about Hellboy. The action was lackluster and should have been more interesting. Hellboy 2 should be the perfect remedy.
8	Ron Perlman held this movie together. What fantastic acting. He was able to use the lines well, and come out cliche-less with the one liners, I was very impressed. He portrayed Hellboy well. However I never felt Hellboy's life was truly in danger. That was a bit of a problem.
1	I give it a 1 because this movie is still better than Daredevil. Nevertheless, everything in this movie makes it a painful waste of time. Silly jokes, bad directing, bad screenplay, horrible dialogues, you name it. A complete disaster in today's movie history.
9	Awesome movie! Everything was cool from the special effects to the acting. There were a few plot holes in the movie, but nonetheless it was great.
5	Ah you know, this movie was better than the crapfest of LXG, but Hellboy himself was lame, being too friendly and having no extroardinary talents, kinda like a weaker hulk with a gun. the comics rule, but abe sapien blows, not being able to fight and not having too awesome powers. the girl was psycho, the kid was lame. the professor was cool, and the Russian Corpse (I capitalize out of respect) was the coolest film character in a while.....he saved the end of the movie which got significantly worse.
3	I was disappointed after the exciting opening of the movie how it became such a standard super hero movie. Hellboy is not a very interesting character, and the story is the same lame hero story that could have been taken from Spiderman, or Superman. The effects are good, but most of the story is pretty lame. While I would not rate it a 1, I would say that the movie goes downhill after the first 30 minutes to a standard boring end.
1	I may not be that bad but I feel I have to bring this average down because it is not representative of what the movie was which is ultimately crap. It is the kind of movie that makes you feel numb at the end and tends to piss you off as you think about it more and more. Ron Pearlman was alright as Hellboy, but whoever wrote the movie didn't want to include any originality, humanity, or anything else that would convince us this movie wasn't just written with some computer movie script software. The story was okay, conversation is the low point with some memorable moments such as the conversation between Hellboy and some random kid on the roof, gee if that is the only conversational piece that I can think of, it must be pretty bad huh. Everything else was recycled, the plot, same story new guy, the dialogue, and the actual character didn't even have any power or anything that would catch our attention. Overall a bore and not worth the time, I normally wouldn't tell anybody this, but even Daredevil was a better movie, that gives an idea of how much I didn't enjoy this film. Go see Bryan Singer's interpretation of the X-Men or go catch Spider-Man 2 which looks to be a hell of a lot more promising than this formulaic crapfest.
6	This movie was ok. I guess with a metacritic score of 70 I was just expecting more. Lots of computer graphics that weren't done too well. They didn't move in a realistic way, the same type of crappy cpu graphics seen in Star Wars Episode 2 when the changing reptile woman crashes her ship.... it looks totally unatural. Another thing, this director Guillermo del Toro needs to be more creative. If im not mistaken, he directed "Blade 2." A few signature effects from that movie are also found in this one so I had the feeling of "Been here, done that." The effects of when Blade kills the vampires and they rip apart in an orangish color. That's used often here. Then another time in this movie, Hellboy slams his fist into the road and stops a car which goes flying over his head into "Bullet Time." Remember in Blade 2 when he used his sword to stop a motorcycle which did a simple flip like in this movie and went into Bullet Time? This movie isn't total crap, it's not that bad 'if' you're in the mood for an action flick with loud sounds, but not much meat to it. I didn't even realize there was a Hellboy comic book.
8	A great flick. Like several other reviewers i was tantalized early on by the beautiful set design, epic plot line and general stylishness, but spiraled a bit into dissapointment as the film unfolded. The problem? Major structural flaws. The film attempts to capture in two hours a tale of very epic scope and ultimately flails its way into mediocrity. The romance element is poorly developed, character development is initiated brilliantly (Blue? the Nazi Assassin) but then fizzles as the film rushes towards its total anticlimax. In fact, the secondary villain (Nazi Assassin) is presented as a seriously badass force to be reckoned with and provides a good bit of dissapointment as he is just elbowed out of the final scenes. All in all the film's problem was in its pacing, spending too much time with banter and moments of humorous slap-stick to do any justice to its epic premise with the two hours alotted. NEVERtheless, it was a dazzling film with something for everyone. The character design, set design, action choreography, plot line, and sheer artistry of the film were awesome, and Ron Perlman was a class-act as Hellboy. With the potential to be a really great and epic action film, like the 5th Element, it is too bad that the film got caught up in some of the classic structural problems, but all in all it was still a very enjoyable feature. 8.
7	Solid!
10	When Spiderman was in the making that it would stink, no one can make a movie out of Marvel comic and make it good. Well, it turns out that it was one great movie! As for Hellboy, I hadn't even heard of it until it came out. I saw it and it was fantastic! Amazing special effects! Good acting, Ron Perlman was superb! The funny dialogue, everything to make it a great film. I think that a flick is a piece of trash a.k.a Dumb and Dumberer, a movie can be good but can be better, a film is a work of art and that does not mean that it can't be bad, but I'm saying that a film you take hard time to make it. Hellboy from its great acting, from its great script, from its great plot, from its great characters, from its GREAT special effects I would have to say it JUST crossed the line from movie to film. For Marvel fans and action, adventure, comedy, horror lovers: THIS IS FOR YOU!
10	Amazing from start to finish. I didn't really expect this to be the greatest comic film ever but after it was over I was thrilled with what I just saw. This film is the defintion of pure fun. It has everythig like, non-stop action, awesome cast, wonderful performance from Ron Perlman, romance and a lot of humor. This is a must see for any comic lover or any person that just wants to have fun. The best comic book film ever, simple as that.
10	This is definitely a comic book masterpiece. This has everything you need to make a great comic book movie, I was just blown away with all aspects of this film. Can't wait for the sequel. Go see this right now.
6	The thing about this movie, and much more movies of this kind of genre is you have to walk into the theatre with an open mind, and not expecting something in the likes of a famous drama like "Rosebud", or an amazing action-thriller like "Die Hard". You really can't be expecting something amazing and prophetic to the film world when you're going to see something that's been criticized as mediocre or "just okay" in the first place. That having been said, "Hellboy" was extremely mixed for me. It contained very good computer graphics and surprisingly good voice-over acting. Definitely not something you'd expect from someone who starred in the TV show "Beauty and the Beast". But, unfortunately, the acting of nearly all the other characters failed to get more than decent. The character of Liz didn't show nearly enough vocal inflection, and let down a character that could have been good. The "father" and John were also mediocre at best, but Abe Sapien was a refreshingly un-superpowered character. The plot was really something that kicked the score down, though. It was relatively unimaginative, flat, and something you'd normally find in a fifty-cent comic book at a 7-11 near you. Even more of a surprise was how the movie tended to dip between good and bad. The beginning was very creative, using the nazi category for something other than a holocoust film. It also incorporated a dark sort of shady, mysterious introduction that segues into something more mediocre. However, by the end, you've really heard all the same things over and over again, and attempting to incorporate a weak romance story and "hellboy pride" theme into movies falls short of anything but pathetic. But, through all its shortcomings, the movie succeded in entertaining, and didn't rely on booming shock moments to entertain. What this movie lacked in overall acting, plot and thoroughness, it made up for in visuals and... well.. more visuals. I would probably give this movie a five normally, but it still contains its own slight charm that keeps it as a mid-tier movie. Go see this movie, but at an empty time, get comfortable and pay attention to detail, not how predictable the plot is.
10	This movie is the best I've seen in a long time. The people that are saying that Hellboy "Doesn't even have an eye-catching superpower" are totally missing the point of this movie. The whole point is showing that you can choose what you are, and are not forced to certain behaviors just because of what you come from (and nothing can be more symbolic of that fact, than a demon being good). Also, Hellboy literally gets the crap beat out him throughout the entire film, (physically and emotionally to an extent) and comes out in one piece. This guy also isn't really a superhero in the classic sense either, he just is what he is, more or less. The graphics are solid, not perfect, but solid. Perlman does an amazing job behind all the make-up and makes us believe the character. Del Toro was extremely passionate with this character and he made an amazing movie. The pacing is superbly done, and doesn't dip or slow at all. The story is great as well, and I honestly don't believe that some of these people were watching the same movie I did. I witnessed nothing that could be described as "structural" flaws within the film, nor was there a predictablity to this either. All in all this is an amazing film, that can be enjoyed by all.
1	Wow ... ! This movie is far worse than Daredevil. I need to start writing screenplays if this is all it takes to be successful. Where to begin.. ? Well the start reminded me of say Indiana Jones when they opened the Holy Grail and the monsters looked like Predator's dog. The dialogue was boring, the characters were uninteresting and the story was so lame I lost interest. I knew there was trouble when they took the picture at the start and it looked like Roger Rabbit special effects. What a stupid super-hero or whatever... Men in Black ripoff organization including the ending where he ends up inside the beast only to blow it up. Wolverine cigar smoking clone with horns... Wow this sucked. Americans really are lowering their standards these days... and some have compared it to Peter Jackson's work or the original Matrix...??????? wtf ???!!!??? Please think for yourself rather than jump on this crap bandwagon.
7	I liked it. Despite some run-of-the-mill elements and easily predictable story, I liked it. I wondered why - there is nothing really innovative in this movie, and the ending lacks both atmosphere and suspense. However, it's all not so important, because of one simple truth: Hellboy is damn cool. He was cool in the comic series, and Ron Perlman does all he can to bring Red's characteristic attitude to the big screen.
4	I don't know what the excitement was about. A cookie-cutter comic book adaptation with a supposedly humorous/emotional element spliced in. A big disappointment. The monsters and special effects would be impressive if we hadn't seen them 100 times already.
1	I gave this movie a 1 instead of 0 because I was supposed to be at work and we are doing inventory. Still I think work may have been more fun than this movie. There is a reason most have never heard of the Dark Horse series, Hellboy the comic book. It sucks. Just because it was a comic doesn't mean it should be a movie. There is nothing compelling here and the characters are sooo dull. Doesn't anyone see the Men in Black similiarities..? The organization, the ending of the movie is exactly what Tommy Lee Jones did with the giant cockroach ! hello ? I saw one guy talked about Indiana Jones comparing it to the start of Hellboy. Another total ripoff. You could go on and on but I won't cuz this movie already wasted enough of my time.
1	There were so many wrong things in this movie. First of all, the plot didn't move at all from the first ten minutes to the last scene. All the characters were paper thin. Some of them made appearance for no more than 10 minutes or suddenly disappeared never to be heard of again. The first monster to be fought persistantly survived throughout the movie without making it more interesting, and then the last monster, a "god" was killed in 3 minutes. That couldn't convince me of a scary apocalypse. Oh yes, the apocalypse. I was surprised to find out the newspaper was still running when the world was ruined to publish a headline saying that the world is ruined. The bad guys had no motive other than to destroy the world (for no good reason). I could go on forever. Main point is, this movie is a hellish maze of plotholes and bad scripting. If I was the director I wouldn't even show this movie to my parents.
6	The dialogue is witty, the characters colourful and pronounced and the atmosphere electric. The pacing was a little off...but...good fun.
5	I have to admit, the first monster that kept coming back over and over was pretty dumb, especially considering it took him approximately 5 minutes to kill the so-called "God" of the movie. I mean, wtf, come on. and it is very similar to the ending in MIB 1. However, the cinematic parts weren't bad, and Hellboy's character was well portrayed, so I couldn't give it more than 5, but I couldn't give it less either. I would say that it "might" be worth watching to some.
7	A fun, inventive movie with heart. Stays gamely truthful to the source content while not being afraid to stamp its own mark on the proceedings. Easily a superior comic book adaptation and a good flick in its own right.
3	What in the world was happening in this movie? It was just a jumbled mess of confusion. Plus the movie was well beyond unrealistic, not to mention just about satanic. Don't watch this garbage, not even at the dollar movie.
8	I usualy don't like superhero movies. But what can I say: Hellboy is just one hell of a fun ride!!!
8	Hellboy is up there with the good comic book movies. It's not quite Batman 1/2, but it's no worse than X-Men 1/2, and far better than Spider Man 1. Hellboy looks good, is really well paced, and has a good sense of humor. Its action is not just explosions and shaky cameras - everything is done with a good sense of style. The wisecracks fall flat from time to time, but enough work so that you don't mind.
8	The little Hell-baby is a special effects triumph, second only to Gollum. It enchants, arguably, the most cuddly non-human since E.T. "Hellboy", to my utter amazement, is almost a real movie because it's not just a special effects extravanga. Hellboy (Ron Perlman), more like Hell-man, is funny, recognizably human. The cat farm speaks volumes about his emotional life. There's verbal and visual wit here. The action has more resonance than your garden variety comic book movie, because the protagonist isn't cardboard, isn't Ben Affleck, is vulnerable. Liz (Selma Blair) saves him in one scene. A woman. Yes, that opening scene goes on a little too long, but "Hellboy" quickly settles down and entertains, and not mindlessly so.
8	I had to write a review mainly because I was so outraged at all the negative comments about this film. I went into the theaters with 0% interest and expecting to be dissapointed, but I really enjoyed this film. Del Toro is a visually keen & fanatical director whose attention to detail & Hellboy's many complexities elevate this film above trash like "LXG" & "Hulk". Not as great as "Spiderman 2" (the best comic book movie ever made) or "X2", but this is still highly underrated and worth a viewing. Ron Perlman is fantastic as well.
4	Boring. Selma Blair's character was like an annoying bug bite that, when combined w/ Hellboy's pathetic unconditional and unwarrented love for her, there was little time left for an actual plot.
6	Please do not my rating wrong way, I Really did enjoy this movie and it has pulled its on weight in the comic book movie genre. To me what stood out is that it seemed that it needed a higher budget, the special affects were good but I wouldn't rate them ground breaking by any means. It seems to me with some really hard work in the story and plot department this really would have been outstanding. your really not sure throughout the movie what exactly the evil plot is that could because of my loud friends causing me to miss the dialogue, but none the less with a stronger plot and a bigger budget it would have been a comic book milestone.
8	This is an action fantasy movie that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever but is enjoyable if you are into that sort of thing. I enjoyed it very much. You have to love a mutant who, after battling numerous evil monsters says "I'm going to be sore tomorrow." Enjoy the action and the campiness. It is all good.
9	Hellboy was a great movie! One of the best Sci-fi movies I've seen since Alien, Aliens, and Predator. A funny exciting action-packed frenzy. Awesome special effects and animation. An awesome movie.
3	This movie was dissapointing to say the least. The story was weak and the characters were uninteresting.
9	The monsters get repititious, the one liners grow stale, and the villians need expansion, but what makes Hellboy great is its humanity. While a virtually invulnerable behemoth, Hellboy is still a man with a heart, one that can be broken. One cannot help but identify with his need to fit in, need to love, and need to be loved. Perhaps Perlmans best moment is the scene in which Hellboy faces impossible odds of monsters to save the woman he loves. Its not the Hell that makes this movie enjoyable, its the boy.
5	This movie seems so short because the storyline and characters do not draw you into the movie another thing was that the fight scenes seemed so short and overall it doesn't even stack up to other great superhero movies like spiderman.
7	Its fun, and good heroes and great villains. Plot was a little thin here and there and the action wasn't amazing.
6	An unbalanced screen time to tell what could have been a great story has left me short and unsatisfied. the characters are well designed but there is just not many of them. the good characters don't appear in scenes that are respectable to their design. one in fact, the young girl is undoubtably taken from an x-men film...yeah, she can control fire, i am burning with amazement (not!). john hurt has always been a favorite actor and he is pretty good in hellboy but again...we don't see him too much. you may say...what DO we see? if not the characters and nor the story?...we see a feature lenght trailer for a cool sci-fi flick, thats what this film is to me...a teaser for hellboy 2. i suggest the director take a good hard look at his movie and give us something more meaty next time around. because, with all it's problems, hellboy is a trip. and we can use another attempt.
7	Don't get me wrong, Ron Perlman is superb and has turned in the defining portrayal of Hellboy - a phrase involving Nails and Heads comes to mind - but the rest of the film let Perlman's great performance down. It just didn't FEEL like Hellboy. Gothic. Ancient. Rural. Folklorey. It had none of these qualities. Too much exposition in the first ten minutes left me feeling like i'd been hit over the head with ten years worth of Hellboy comics. Hollywood always falls into this trap. "The audience isn't familiar with this character, so let's treat them like morons and explain VERY SLOWLY and VERY CAREFULLY what is going on". Throughout the whole thing i was sitting there thinking: "where have i seen this before?" and the answer came to me time and time again: "oh, yeah. Men In Black". They may as well have renamed this film "Men In Hell" or "Boy In Black". Hellboy does not run around city streets chasing after slimy tentacled aliens, sorry... Demons, and fighting them in subway stations, MIB do that. At the risk of sounding like a bitching fanboy (I'm not really THAT familiar with the character, I've just read a couple of the comics) Hellboy fights ghouls and goblins and leprehauns and rotting corpses and things that hang about in graveyards. More often than not he kills them by casting a spell or hitting them with a horseshoe (evil beings hate iron, you see). The only point at which this film really felt like Hellboy was the bit in the graveyard when he woke up the corpse to ask directions. Now THAT'S the type of thing Hellboy does! I pricked up my ears at that point thinking it was going to get more Hellboy-ish, but then they went underground and ended up in the Mines of Moria and it could have been any other superhero film. Then finally, to top the whole thing off, Hellboy does the comedy climbing-inside-a-monster and blowing-it-up-from-the-inside which we've all seen before... in MIB. Great entertainment but not original in the way that Hellboy-the-comic is. Maybe I was expecting too much, the critics seemed to love it, it just wasn't the film i wanted it to be. Still, it's worth a 7 and that's not bad.
6	An adaptation of Hellboy had a great deal of potential with so many outlandish and original ideas at its disposal, but despite the impressive visuals, especially considering its £66 million budget (compared to the more bland looking X-Men 2 which set the studio back by over $130 million) Hellboy just fails to make much of an impact. The story is frenetically rushed the script is in desperate need of an injection of wit. Great production design though.
10	This Movie I Think Is The Best Movie On Earth And (Ron Pearlman) (Selma Blair) (Rupert Evans) And (Jeffery Tambor) I Think R The Best Actors That Ever Lived.
0	Shockingly bad.
3	This film, while has some redeeming factors (like its cool use of makeup) is a horrendous movie that is shockingly horrible. It suffers from any kind of logic and is so horrible, I can't believe I'm awarding it 3/10!
5	Interesting idea, but the plot was pretty weak; character development was just ok. Predictable. Not funny, not scary, not really that excitining...what is it???
4	You can't make a Hollywood movie without a love story (it's a way to bring girls in theaters?) - a (dark) horror/paranormal comic book turned into a (bright) fantastic movie...that's not good.
10	I got the three disc extended edition for my birthday. It's thirteen minutes longer and adds more sufficent character development while still retaining the pace and excitement of the original version.
10	Aww This Movie Freggin Rocks The Best Movie Ever Made I Freggin Love This Movie Man I Watch This Movie Like Everyday Man This Movie Rocks Love This Freggin Movie (Ron Perlman) And (Selma Blair) R The Best Actors That Ever Lived Cant Get Enough Of This Movie U Guys Need To See This Movie My Fav. Part Is At The End Where Hellboy And Liz Kiss Its So Sweet I Wish That Could Have Been Me I Wish So Bad.
5	Neat looking.
7	The first time I watched this movie I was not impressed. The villains had the potential to be cool but had so little air time and character development they became 2D figures (especially compared to the amount of time spent developing the protagonists). Ilsa especially was not worth having in the movie (which is a shame because a German bombshell could have made a good villainess). The plot was pretty standard: evil priest wants to summon in the outer gods (HP Lovecraft stuff here), and the valiant Americans must save the world. Can these yankee chumps continue to try and prove that they won WWII alone any other way than rewriting history? Hellboy is a great character brilliantly protrayed by Pearlmen (he's come a long way from In the Name of the Rose and Beauty and the Beast), the other characters are fun (especially "Niles" and the FBI Director). The FX are good, nothing to complain about. Music score is good. The plot. Weak weak weak. I didn't even realize what was essentially wrong with it until I read other reviews, and then it occured to me: I'd seen it before! The ending swallowed by monster then blows it up a la MiB was anticlimatic and cheesy. The motivation for the entire "plot" was fine (Hellboy ends up being the key to the apocalypse is nice), but the journey to this was confused and often irrelevant. Should have been a TV series.
0	Utter pap! The acting was so wooden it was unbelievable!
8	As much as the acting and writing could have been improved, Del Toro still brought us the best looking monsters i've ever seen in a movie. And that's no mean feet.
9	Good adaptation of an awesome graphic novel.
9	To not be charmed or entertained by this film would require either a heart of stone or an utter lack of taste in entertainment. It does an excellent job of creating a comic book feel and look, and Ron Perlman's hellboy is more than likable enough to carry multiple films. So what if the plot can be a bit hard to follow at times. Since when did that matter much for a comic book film?
7	Nazis open evil portal helped by evil monk, hellboy arrives, US troops shut portal, 60 years later, Hellboy works for Government, evil monk returns.. Slightly better than average superhero picture with some decent effects & good action scenes let down by awkward story telling. Ron Perlman is pretty good in the lead despite the cliched dialogue & the 107 year old Nazi assassin is a right nasty piece of work.
9	A truly enjoyable movie, while it borrows some elements from Wolfenstien like Germans opening a portal to hell during WWII, and a top secret government paranormal defence agency, but the unique science fiction plot will have you hooked, a blast to watch with great action and humor, truly enjoyable.
8	I had heard of Hellboy before, but had never read a single comic, but when that first magnificent trailer came out, I was looking forward to this one big time. It just had a fantastic look to it and once I finally saw it, it also had a good story to go with that look. Ron Perlman is Hellboy, fantastic casting in this situation. Guillermo Del Toro has a very unique look to his films that are inventive and magnificent. It was funny, engrossing, the cinematography was excellent (Hellboy against a snowy backdrop looks awesome!) and its pace was great. Most like the sequel better, but while it was a great sequel, for me it didnâ
6	Guillermo Del Toro's "Hellboy" isn't exactly a balanced movie; it kinda sides with the friendly side, which results in less action sequences than you think. Nevertheless, its still a visually great film to watch.
6	I enjoyed the film to a certain point and when I asked myself (at the end) how I managed to sit through this rather stupid film. The entire plot (while interesting at first) was incredibly stupid, Even for comic book movie standards. The main cast was good for the most part. Ron Perlman was perfect for Hellboy and was an outstanding lead and the rest of the cast was good except for Karl Roden, He was a terrible villian and ruined the film with his horrible acting imo. The action was good and it did a good job blending the CGI/Animated sequences with the real life ones. Guillermo del Toro is a great director and Hellboy was a passion project for him but was it wise to make this movie? I cant say yes or no. It was a solid film and worth the watch if you can get through it.
0	I tagged along with two friends who wanted to see this. I apologized for laughing. Then they too started laughing. Then we walked out. The ticket guy asked how the movie was and i farted.
5	It's got some good qualities, but it's got some bad ones too. Hellboy is scattershot, but it delivers the visuals, and everyone who worked the make-up for this comic-book flick deserves a medal, or maybe an Oscar.
8	With an amiable lead performance from Ron Perlman and some truly phenomenal visuals, "Hellboy" proves to be an extremely engaging cinematic experience.
7	Sporting a great quantity of keen visuals and impressive costume designs, Del Toro's comic adaptation manages to astonish with its unique style and appealing characters.
6	Hellboy spits fire. A very unlikely hero from another dimension, amazingly ends up being a pretty solid overall film. A very humanizing tale on and otherwise other worldly creature, and a collection of good action sequences make this more than just your average super.
6	"Hellboy", you must admit, is a unique movie that feels like a comic book movie, but it isn't based on it. This movie has energy and is dark and thrilling. The dialogue, however, in the film is pretty bad at times. Overall, after watching this film, I wasn't disappointed with it, but I wasn't very pleased with it either.
10	Hellboy: 10 out of 10: Hellboy is one of the three best comic book adaptations of the last ten years. Now considering the recent spate of mediocre comic book adaptations this is a bit like winning a beauty contest at a fat farm. Hellboy is simply head and shoulders above those. It is on par with the recent Spiderman movies (Hellboy sports a better hero and better CGI effects while Spiderman takes the nod in the love interest and villains categories) better than the X-men films and simply puts other comic book adaptations to shame (League of Extraordinary Gentleman should be particularly embarrassed) Hellboy starts with a rip-off of one of the last scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark and introduces such horrible clichÃ©d villains as Nazi babe and Rasputin. Yet the scene works. Director Guillermo del Toro nails a comic book style to the direction that keeps the action and humor going during the most implausible circumstances. Another kudos is in order for the special effects, both make-up (which is spot on) and CGI. Now I seem to hate most CGI effects. Many a big-budget Hollywood film has come out recently with horrible special effects that stick out despite 50 million plus budgets. Hellboy's effects are simply seamless where one forgets that entire characters and locations are digitally generated. The acting is also seamless with lead Ron Perlman giving a scene stealing cigar chomping performance that rivals Daniel Day Lewis's turn in Gangs of New York and Jeffrey Tambor turning a stock clichÃ© (obstructionist bureaucrat who wants to shut everything down) into a humanistic sympathetic character. (This is also an example of very smart writing that makes even the clichÃ©d characters into three-dimensional figures.) While all is not perfect (In addition to Nazi Chick and Rasputin we also have a Clock/Sand Nazi and a Space Cthulhu as an improbable villains) Hellboy is better than an action movie should be, much better than a comic book adaptation ought to be, and immeasurable better than a movie called Hellboy deserves to be.
6	Not visually stunning, but there is still something in the movie that keeps you watching all the way from beginning to the end. It is funny, corny, and something beyond those two.
5	Hellboy is a well designed, visually appealing comic book movie from Guillermo Del Toro. Unfortunately, thin plotting and the lack of any decent action sequences scupper any good intentions. Hellboy is ultimately forgettable super-hero fodder.
4	Watched it recently on BD. Its not a very good movie. Story is pretty lame. The entire movie doesn't look very good.. Acting was sort of ok I guess. Not much action to speak off.
6	Much like the Punisher, Hellboy was created for the older comic book fans. The character was designed to be an anti-hero, less refined than Batman or Superman, someone who would hate being labeled a superhero. While the comics weren't as popular as others, the film gave life to the franchise and created a cult following. The story is meant to introduce us to the character of Hellboy, a cat loving, cigar smoking, red guy, with a bad attitude, who secretly works for the government protecting The United States from paranormal threats. Everyone knows by now that I hate superheroes, so the idea of the anti-hero really appealed to me. I could have easily become one of the cult followers and fallen for Hellboy, the way all the comic-con kids did, if it wasn't for the uncertain direction of the film. Guillermo Del Toro struggled back and fourth with whether or not this film should be geared for kids or adults, and went the PG-13 route. It worked in terms of getting a larger audience, but it also took away from the original intent of the character. Throughout the film we keep hearing about how tough and dangerous Hellboy is, but he's really wasn't that much of a bad ass. If Hellboy is so unlike any hero, why is he working for government instead of breaking the law, and why is it that he doesn't utter a single curse word? The character was far too toned down for my liking, but the flip-side to that was how nasty and creepy some of the bad guys were. Broom is one of the best comic villains I've ever seen and given his Nazi background, he most certainly was not intended for kids. Overall, I enjoyed parts of the film, I loved Ron Perlman, and as with any film by Guillermo Del Toro, the special effects were amazing. However, the lack of direction makes the film somewhat unfulfilling and anti-climatic. Hopefully that will all change when I get up to Hellboy II.
7	Hellboy is an amazing thrill ride. Not only was it great to pick Ron Perlman, it was great to make this movie. The plot was fun, the effects and music were great, and the fish guy was awesome. My only tiff is sometimes the effects were cheesy. But if you can deal with that youll love this movie.
6	This movie has some cool action scenes and is surely especially fun to watch for comic book geeks (I had no prior knowledge of Hellboy, though). The story isn't bad, either, but the dialogue isn't the best and, in reality, it just isn't all that entertaining. I'm saying you should watch this film if you think it looks interesting but you shouldn't expect anything outstanding, just a decent action flick.
4	If you love the comic, the movie is tolerable; if you know nothing about the comic, don't bother. Some visual effects are quite neat, but a lot of the CG really falls flat. The acting is mostly flat and uninspired across the board. I felt no passion or hatred for any of the characters at any time in the movie. They should have selected Bullseye or Kingpin as the villain...., not both, it left both feeling undeveloped and unscary.
3	There seems to be little or no character building through the movie, what little screen time they have Michael Clarke Duncan, Collin Farrell, Jon Favreau etc, did a lot better than Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner. This proves Ben Affleck doesn't have what it takes to be a main male role!!
6	A movie whose parts are far better than the sum. Affleck is fairly winning as Murdock/Daredevil, Garner lights up the screen whenever she is on it, and Farell and Duncan make convincing baddies. However, painfully wooden and obvious writing, and a lack of anything compelling in the direction of this film keep it from becoming something more unique. High point of the film is a playground flirtation/duel between Affleck and Garner -- the sparks are palpable and the wirework nifty and clean. From there on out, it's all downhill. However, it remains an intriguing set of characters and an interesting world -- let's hope that if there is a sequel, it will expand greatly the romantic/spiritual/physical areas just touched on here -- as well as being handed over to a more subtle writer and a director who can stage an action scene.
2	Affleck and Garner don't do much. The opening NYC night sequences actually look like cheap cartoons rather than contemporary CGI. Colin Farrell is great, but doesn't get enough screen time to keep this turkey airborne. Affleck is a fine actor and has done well in films like Good Will Hunting, but director Johnson gets nothing out of him here--partly because Johnson's leaden script gives him nothing to start from. Favreau is a trooper and does his best, but looks a little chunky. Michael Clarke Duncan normally can do no wrong and when he's on the screen you tend to forget how crappy the film is for a minute, but not even he can make gold out of lead. Bottom line: This one should have gone direct to video. Sequel? Maybe guest starring the Rugrats.
5	Satisfactory movie with improved special effects (compared to Spider-man). Shootout scenes are quite impressive special fx, but movement around buildings looks EXACTLY like spider-man, which sucks. Daredevil is also much darker film than Spider-man which makes it less of a movie for little kids.
3	Dark, violent and lame. The director seemed to feel the need to show us the boots of the characters every time they landed from a death-defying leap. Once was plenty.
4	I didn't have very high expectations for this movie and I'm glad I didn't (I would have given it a 2). Weak characters, CG effects were too obvious, and the story was uninspiring. Too bad, because DD was a cool character and KingPin was a white guy!
7	My girlfriend and I greatly enjoyed this movie. I was a little worried about the darkness of Daredevil to be honest but it wasn't bad. It was a movie about a comic book hero, and, altho X-Men did it better (I was one of the few people in America who didn't like Spider Man ) it gave me what I expected. However, I gotta admit that thankfully Bullseye was in the movie (he was great). However, MC Duncan was disappointing as the Kingpin. He looked the part, but wasn't menacing enuff. Otherwise, good movie and the 'tag' during the credits was funny!
1	It's stupid, and thats the bottom line.
7	Sure, it's entertaining enough. But it's a joke. Even with super sound radar sense, a blind guy couldn't do all that.
8	I wouldn't buy this movie, but it's worth watching in theatres. Who cares about the plot? Just watch the special effects.
6	A movie full of nothing but it is entertaining. It has some good fight scenes and shocking moments, but that just doesn't add up. I thought ben Afleck sleepwalked through the roll but the movie was saved my Jennifer Garner. I love her. I would recommend this movie to people because you will have fun, but there isn't a lot of substance.
10	It is cool i love it all the cool effects and the action i want to see this movie again.
7	The good news: for those people whose complaint about poor translations between books and movies, Daredevil managed to retain most of the Frank Miller elements that made Matt Murdock and Electra the most popular angst couple in the Marvel universe. The movie takes particular pleasure in showing off as to how much Daredevil isn't so much of a superhuman, but just a plain human despite his amped up abilities. As a whole, Daredevil does a good job in making sure people are reminded comic heroes aren't just for kids and webslingers. The bad news: the movie relies a bit too much on expounding Matt's disability and his broken heart, inevitably failing to produce a solid storyline. It's a disappointment only because all the elements were placed properly to make Daredevil into a great story, even with Ben Afleck at the helm, but because of poor timing, bad transitions, and a few story holes, all that's left is a movie about a really pissed off blind guy with an incredibly defined sense of hearing and vengance.
1	This a horrible film. The previews that precede it were more interesting. Affleck, Farrell and Duncan are horrible. Favreau is okay and Garner is pretty good. If you liked her in this watch her on ALIAS. It is the best on TV.
10	Before going to see the movie I read all the critics from several newspapers, and of course I got a bad impression .. well I love Daredevil and I collect all the comic books and I wanted to give it a try. Well in all honesty I liked the movie a lot, probably more then Spiderman, the noir side of the movie is well depicted, the special effect may look too "Spidermanlike", but overall do an excellent job in the fast action sequences (too few in all honesty). The movie is not 100% consistent with the original story (where is Daredevil's master, the guy who teaches him the art of fighting even if blind ?). probably i can criticize the poor characters description as for Kingpin and Bullseye. Affleck plays a decent part and only god knows why they wantred him as Murdok, Electra is electrifying. So I would suggest that if u are a (big) fan of the comic book this movie is really worth to be seen since it leaves several of things to the imagination (knowledge) of the audience, if u are not a fan u might be little bit disappointed especially if u compare this movie to "Spiderman".
1	I will preface the following by saying that i went into the theater with exceedingly low expectations. I was duly impressed by how completely all of them were disappointed, even ones for the existence of a plot. This movie is essentially 20 to 25 minutes of weak, predictable story, spaced out by jennifer garner's breasts (easily the movie's most versatile character) and CGI that only achieves the level of "Hey Bubba, you see dem flipping and stuff? that was coo, man!" All this is topped by what is easily the worse performance of Affleck's career (anyone see Reindeer Games?) Two hours I will never get back...
8	Why does everyone hate this movie so much? I think it was better than Spiderman and much less childish. Despite what everyone says, I don't think Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner did a horrible job and Farrell did a great job playing a psycohpathic killer. Duncan did a pretty bad job as the King Pin because he didn't seem threatening enough. Although Daredevil was sometimes predictable I really enjoyed it.
8	Enjoyable. Jennifer Garner is awesome and who doesn't love a super hero movie?!
8	I went into the theatre expecting a pretty sucky movie, since I thought the trailers were awful. I was plesantly surprised. The movie is much better than Spiderman, the dialogues are a lot deeper and the characters' interactions are actually interesting. Garner did a great job, Affleck wasn't bad either (thats saying a lot coming from me, I hate the guy). Overall, quite an entertaining movie, well worth the $7 I paid for it.
0	Ranks up there with battlefield earth.
8	I thought that this was an alright movie. I enjoyed the large amount of action, and I like the storyline. I thought that, despite how impressive the graphics were, they could have been used more and could have been touched up a little more. I am glad they did not do to many things similar to the Spiderman movie. All in all, it is a very enjoyable movie that I recommend should be viewed by many.
8	Hehe my first movie review...here goes. I thought this movie was pretty kewl. Garner and Farrell were wicked. Benny....go join the preschoolers club. I liked this movie a lot especially at the daredevil and electra fights they were awesomeness. Anywho i highly reccomend this to those blood thirsty fight wanters........this is very entertaining. It was boring at some parts so i gave it an 8. Great movie. THUMBS UP!!!!!
0	I like comic book superhero movies and all I have to say about dirtdevil is "What a waste of time!!!"
7	There were pretty good moments. I enjoyed the movie. The graphics were amazing but they could have been more and of even higher quality. Ya. There was some great acting and it would have been nice to see even more of the childhood of the Daredevil. A great movie altogether.
2	When i read a bunch of reviews saying that this movie was really good, i decided to see for myself. maybe i was expecting too much, but i thought it was very lame. some of the acting was alright, but i must say that most of it wasn't very convincing to me. the relationship between daredevil and electra was sweet, but seemed very unrealistic. they had only known eachother for a day (or something like that), and suddenly they were in love and couldn't live without eachother. the graphics were't all that great either. some of the fighting was, er, interesting, but all in all i thought it was lame and wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money on a movie like daredevil.
9	I give this movie a nine. All the reviews say that affleck did a bad job but he played the part well, for a guy who is not such an action star. Affleck is a great actor; when he has matt damon with him, which is why I'm shocked that he did a good job in this film. As for Garner, they made a great choice. She was able to do most of the stunts herself, and she is knows the martial arts. As for Clarke, I was a little dissapointed not in his acting, but in his part. Kingpin is supposed to be an excellent fighter. He would not have went down that easy. I also do not believe that he was from the Bronx.
0	Sucked!
10	Better than Spiderman, even though I prefer Toby Maguire to Ben Affleck. I'm not a lesbian so I have nothing to say about Jennifer Garner exept she did a good acting job. I loved Bullseye!
10	It?s hard to believe what the negative reviews have to say about this masterpiece. This movie was intended to be dark and serious. It is unfair that people are comparing it to Spiderman. Most open minded people would accept the fantastic nature of a superhero action movie. Some people complain that the characters can jump too far. Hell, you could say that about Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon too. These are action movies where this sort of thing is EXPECTED! The movie was good in its interpretation of the Daredevil comics and conveyed the story to newcomers very well. I learned that the motion picture rating board forced the director to cut the movie to remove violence several times in order to avoid a R rating rather than the PG13 rating that was intended.
5	A so, so film. Don't get me wrong the action scenes and costumes are top-notch. The film just didn't have all the actors and story line to match.
0	Anyone who could give this drek a 10, then I will give it a 0. Absolutely horrible. Don't waste your time.
10	This movie was so good...Affleck did a great job and the action was marvelous :P
2	This movie totally reeked! Some say that this film isn't childish like Spider-Man, well I thought this drek was plain stupid like the fight scene between Garner and Affleck in the playground (and among other things). And I cannot believe that some of you consider Daredevil to be "dark". Micheal Jackson's skin color is darker than this film's tone. True "dark" superhero films, for example, are The Crow and Batman Returns, not this devilish bullsh*t. This film's not recommended for hypocrites like me.
8	Well, I was surprised. Ben Affleck makes a good Daredevil. Jennifer Garner makes a sexy Elektra. Colin Farrell is sensational as Bullseye=right on target! Michael Clarke Duncan perfect as Kingpin. A lotta fun! Too violent for the kiddies.
10	I thought it was a great movie. Wonder if they will make a sequel.
0	Bleahch!
8	Quality is always to be delivered with Fox, and "Daredevil" is no exception. It features stunning special effects and an enjoyable romp onto the action scene. Overall, an effective translation to film from comic. One accuracy qualm though: why the hell is the Kingpin black?
0	Are you people nuts? This movie makes no sense and the storyline sucks. If you want to see a better movie, stick on with spider-man and spriggan. Those two are a lot sexier than daredevil.(Eat it up, loser.)
0	After avoiding this dud for months, I was nudged into catching it at a local dollar cinema by some clueless frieds. Well, the first few minutes weren't exactly horrible, but then the plot became so stupidly derivative that I fell asleep mid-way through and woke up in time to realize, to my real horror, that this cinematic disaster is likely to spawn a sequel or two. The shame and the waste... of my time, I mean. If at least the theater had had decent seats.
8	I thought that this was a very interesting comic book movie movie that was too underrated. The actors handled the movie very seriously and they came out with a very intriguing film. I'd pass Daredevil, Elektra, and Bullseye over Spiderman, Mary Jane, and the Green Goblin any day. It should have made $140+ million. This movie should not be missed.
5	I wasn't running to the theatres to catch this movie. Spider-man and X-men were great (ignoring the fact that they didn't follow the comic book storyline). Comic book movies are a fad like reality TV. All in all, Daredevil isn't all that bad, its fun, and has that comic book theme to it. See it if there's nothing else, but I wouldn't make it a first pick.
9	While it is a very dark and sometimes serious movie, it was funny in bits with a very good -not confusing- storyline. it is also very modern and deserves 4 stars /5.
2	Ok picture this, the wife (who hates action movies) is out on the town, I've got the DVD player & a bottle of Jack Daniels to myself. I have the opportunity to see any... film... I ... choose. And arse that I am I choose Daredevil. After sitting through Armageddon and Sum Of All Fears, I promised myself I'd never watch another Ben Afflek movie, but no... "this one might be OK" I thought "he might have discovered some talent" I thought. Bollocks! Is the reply. This film is SOOO bad that were it not so tedious it might possibly work as a Mel Brooks type spoof of Superhero movies. Afflex is a ham who looks like a side of beef. In short he's a meathead and I was begging Colin Farrell just to kill off our hero and put me out of my misery but unfortunately it wasn't to be. This boring ejaculate pretending to be an adaptation of the only comic book I read as a kid get's 2 points. One because Colin Farrel at least borders on entertaining in his all too brief role, and Jennifer Garner made me go "woah mamma" a couple of times as she is rather hot. In short, I want my money back. No seriously I could have been watching City Of God instead. I WANT MY MONEY BACK AFFLEK!
1	Money back . Total rubbish.
6	This is a mindless teen flick but I knew that when I rented it. Movies based on comic book characters are not Shakespeare. This movie is fine if you want action and more action and more action and not a lot of plot. There is always something slightly appealing about testosterone filled young men such as Ben Affleck and Colin Farrell who are full of piss and vinegar.
7	This movie is fairly decent. Lots of action, intrigue and special effects. I would add it to my movie collection, but probably only watch it upon arriving home from the store,put it back on the shelf and not touch it for a year. Better than X-men and The Hulk in my opinion.
1	Blah.
8	This is the one of the few times Critics have gotten this movie VERY wrong. The movie not only has much originality and spark to it, it is far exceeds Spider-Man in storyline (which has a million cliches). This is not really an action flick, but more of a character story. Seeing this movie, the characters are real and have true conflict rather than incosequential action sequences. They are not invincible, but rather human and that is the focus of this movie. DareDevil is a man with mystery, pain, and the movie even struts some Shakespearian style. Elektra a person who refuses to be anybody victims, and Bullseye a flashy egotistcal villian. Watching it more than once, I realized great symbolisc and artistic staging missed, and most likely others did. The actors do their roles flawlessly and with passion. They are in a very emotionally absorbing film and I think anybody who cannot see that is emotionally crippled or came in expecting more cheap action like the majority of the American public. While the film has a few missed oppurtunties to expand on its "moral complexity" that the director hoped for, this movie is perhaps the great comic book adaptation (The Hulk possibly tying). I especially disagree with the ignorant critic who said this movie tooks no dares. DareDevil is underelaborated for effect, he often does things which are not logically explained, and the other I will not spoil. That critic was especially off. DareDevil is a very worth wild movie for someone who is willing to open their mind WITH their eyes.
1	I just saw this on HBO and, my God, what a crock of clichéd crap. Daredevil fans may like it for seeing their favorite hero in live-action (which, admittedly, was done well), but unless you're a fan, there really is no good reason to waste your time watching this movie. It's a meandering, predictable mess. And the fight scene in front of the playground? What the hell? That has to be the single stupidest thing I've seen in a movie ever.
10	The hero in this movie has to overcome so many barriers to his life. The only wish I have for this great movie is that the woman lived and fought the good fight with the Daredevil. After all, it just might be a devil that could also save us. A good devil is rare, but they do exist.
10	Fantastic special effects and heart breaking love between a man and a woman. Their love will live forever. Yes! The scene of her face in the rain of sonic noise was so beautiful. A very good job from the cast.
4	When I went to go see this movie I thought it was going to be horrible. All I heard were negative things about this movie. I thought to myself, "Ben Affleck as a superhero? Give me a break!". When I went to go saw it it actually wasn't bad! It wasn't good either. It was just an average movie. There was nothing special about it, and nothing to horrible about it either, except Jennifer Garner's atrocious acting. Ben Affleck is pretty bad actor, but not as bad as her. Other cast members were a delight to watch such as Colin Farrel, Jon Favreau, Joe Pantoliano and Kevin Smith in a tiny cameo as a person working at a morgue. The thing I really don't get though is, in the comic book the character of Kingpin is white. The man who plays him, Michael Clarke Duncan, is black. And another thing, the original Kingpin wasn't muscular and strong like Michael Clarke Duncan, he was morbidly obese. It has some cool special effects in the movie, but nothing too spectacular. I think the character of Bullseye, played by Colin Farrel was pretty interesting and kind of funny. In the beginning there is a cameo by Robert Iler who plays AJ Soprano on "The Sopranos" as a bully who beats up Daredevil as a boy. The movie is worth watching if you have nothing better to do, but don't go out of your way to see it. I know I wouldn't. (2/14/03)
6	I am an avid Daredevil comic book collector, and I must say I have mixed feelings on the film. The storyline was okay, and it had a good look and feel to it, but I just can't get over them casting Ben Affleck as Daredevil. If someone else had gotten the part this movie would have been much better.
0	This is the worst superhero movie since Captain America, and Ben Affleck is the worst actor of our generation.
10	Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner do amazing in this great, dark movie.
7	Not bad. Expected it to suck, but it actually worked within the parameters of the given story. Good fun.
8	I can see how people hated this movie and loved. I for one and none of them, I am one of the people that just flat out enjoyed it. I liked the effects, the dialouge isn't that bad and it was sometimes pretty funny. I liked this movie. In fact, I liked it a lot.
2	In the genre, this film is a prime example of how not to do it. As a movie in general, it is absolutely lousy. Predictable, cliche, with rather uninspired action sequences, and average acting at best. A waste of time for anyone who doesn't have a particular interest in the main character.
1	Piece of crap. Especially when that mute keeps saying "I never miss!" what's that about?! One of THE worst films I have ever seen. Ben Affleck should be ashamed. Period.
10	I don't understand why people think this is so bad, just remove the terrible music and the crappy fight scene in the park and you have a great movie. I think if they released the director's cut in cinemas it would have made a lot more money. You should watch the director's cut it awesome!
3	Mildly entertaining and not much more. The reason why everyone bags on this movie? It's cheesy, Nachio heesy! Concept is great and another Hollywood easy out by going to the comic book well at it's finest. The story is solid though if not a little disconnected. M Duncan as the big boss is a bit of a redirect from the comic but he pulls it off smashingly.
8	I know what your thinking. 8 for Daredevil? The original is worth 6 at most, the 8 is for the Directors Cut version, which is better than the original cinematic version. For the Directors Cut, a sub-plot is added where Matt and Foggy Nelson take the case of a murdered prostitute, with a drug addict framed for the murder, played by Coolio. This addition makes the film seem darker than the original cut. Foggy Nelson is given more to do than be just the lawyers sidekick and we get more time with Matt Murdock as a lawyer than a masked vigilante. Also, the reason the cops come for Kingpin at the end seems more believable than in the original cut. The opening origin is extended, focusing more upon Matts catholic upbringing and making us feel more for his relationship with his father, which makes it more tragic when his father is murdered. However, many flaws still remain. The playground fight scene's a big one, and you can't help but feel that Jennifer Gardners casting as Elektra was just stunt casting, due to her being in Alias. I personally liked Colin Farrels portrayal as Bullseye. He plays the character crazy and enjoyable, just like Bullseye. I feel they missed a trick though. When Bullseye asks Kingpin for a costume, that was the right moment for Bullseye to get his Marvel costume. But seeing Ben Afflecks gimpy DD costume and the schoolgirl Elektra, maybe a Bullseye costume was better left undone. Michael Clarke Duncan will always be John Coffey off the Green Mile for me, so I'm not fully convinced as him playing Kingpin. I was convinced in his battle with Daredevil and him talking with Bullseye, but not much else. And Ben Affleck as Daredevil? I honestly didn't mind him. Who would've thought the addition of Coolio would help this become a better film? Still confounded by Ben Urich finding the gasoline/alcohol marked DD which he set on fire...
4	For a superhero that's supposed to be so dark and tortured by guilt (emotional and Catholic), Daredevil is a rather goofy movie. It's dialogue feels like it was written by someone who had never read a comic book trying to emulate one, and scene after scene of forced drama (and by drama, I mean play a ton of emo songs).
4	"Daredevil" is just the worst movie you can think of in Marvel Studios. It has crappy CGI, undeveloped romance between Affleck and Garner (in the movie), and a monotonous length that rushes towards the end.
5	This film isn't the scarring experience I was expecting (for that I watched Electra) but it didn't live up to what it could have been. It seemed that Daredevil took the middle ground and stayed there with it aspiring to be something more than average but never really putting in the effort. I normally don't appreciate super hero movies for the same reason in that they are way too upbeat and when a comic book film tries to show real darkness it usually fails quite miserably. However Daredevil actually does have a nice tone in its darkness, the mixture of colours actually provides for a pleasant viewing experience with there being some truly clever direction in places (rain face). I'm not saying its high art but it works with there being some incredibly visceral moments. If anything the movie annoys with the fact it embraces a little too much its comic book roots in its representation of Bullseye who (with the help of Colin Farrell) manages to drive the viewer up the wall. Daredevil made some moves to be unique but overall just didn't put in enough effort to pull it off. Also Jon Favreau needs to stop playing the jovial sidekick, if you've seen Swingers you know it is beneath him
2	The only good parts of this film are the flashback scenes to his past, Besides that the entire film sucked. The cast was terrible and the whole idea of this film was just an epic failure.
4	I recently read Brian Michael Bendis' run on Daredevil and was blown away by how good it was. Out of curiosity (and my better judgement) I decided I had to watch this movie. Unfortunately, the quality of the comic book is lost to the film. Director Mark Steven Johnson got just about everything wrong. The casting was poor - the most obvious example is Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin. In the comics, he's a fat white guy. In the film, hes a black body builder. I could have lived with this if Michael Clarke Duncan could play the role of a villain - but he's just to damn charming. Ben Affleck was mis-cast, as was Jennifer Garner. Their combined acting was pretty poor - I just couldn't suspend my belief long enough to accept either of them as heroes. I think the director just tried to cram too much into this film. The film covers Matt Murdock gaining his powers (and disability) as a child, his fathers death, his career as a lawyer, his romantic relationship with Elektra, his friendship with Foggy Nelson and Ben Ulrich and his feud with both Bullseye and Kingpin. It was just too much - the movie was saturated and watered down with plot devices. Aesthetically speaking, the film was too dark. Many of the scenes were filmed at night or in dark interiors. I found it distracting during the action scenes; the sequences were hard to follow because of the dimly lit sets. Finally, I'd just like to point out that this movie is CHEESY. Good god. I actually laughed out loud a couple of times because of how bad the acting/dialogue was. The bottom line? Skip it, especially if you're a fan of the Daredevil comics.
5	Other good title. I meet the Daredevil story, and is beautiful, is same like the batman's story, but this adaptation is some regular, some performance are good, but others no much, the story of this film is regular, and a lot of boring. I think that is a correct film, special mention to the church scene, is fantastic. In no much words, a correct film.
4	Excluding some impressive stunts, there's just not much here if you look at all the money and star power that went into making it.
2	Ben Affleck is a tool. He's about as believable a super hero as I am a super model. Ben, do us all a favor, stick to directing and romantic comedies so that I don't have to see you anymore!
7	A decent superhero flick but compared to the likes of Spider-Man, etc there are just better ones out there to look to instead. I actually enjoyed the Elektra prequel that followed more than this, but enough about the bad because its still a good film with an interesting premise and a good line-up of actors. The problem is it never really grabs you and you don't really fall in love with any of the characters so I found myself drifting throughout, but still there's enough here for it to be enjoyed.
4	It's not enough to make a regular popcorn superhero flick when films like Spider-Man as well as X-men has wit, character development and high-octane action sequences that makes them great movies all around. Ben Affleck fits the role for Matt Murdock/Daredevil but the movie is, ultimately, too derivative to be on par with other superhero movies. It does have enough moments that, without them, would've made the movie much worse than it already is but the rest of the characters don't get their showcase, especially Elektra.
4	There are moments of undeniably zippy fun, but Daredevil suffers from indolent acting, incoherent pacing and a monotonous script that's weak compared to the average superhero movie standard.
0	Bad script, bad actors, bad felling, pointless.... The movie dont have any good point.. Unfortunately i had watch on the cinema. Was a wasteof money..
5	To be fair, I didn't hate this movie. There was allot I liked and I thought Affleck didn't do a bad job. He looked like Daredevil and his Matt Murdock was a little wimpy, but good enough. I really don't like how much he gets trashed, since it wasn't him that was wrong with the movie, but the writing and directing. How could Garner be cast as Elektra? This role was clearly design for Michelle Rodriguez. Garner was terrible in the movie. Enough on this. Farrell is just fantastic as Bullseye. I do question the movies design for his character, but I guess it's fine. Michael Clarke Duncan is just phenomenal as Kingpin, granted the race change has a little odd at first, but he nails the character, both in delivery and in physically. Overall: Daredevil Is a badly written and poorly directed mess by someone who clearly lacks the experience for this kind of movie. Luckily the actors (not Garner) do save the film from being a total failure.
7	Okay superhero movie, at best. The score and dialogue are pretty unintelligent, but the added imparity of blindness to the protagonist adds for at least a little something extra.
7	Daredevil is a great movie, for the Marvel fans (at least.). Ben Affleck is a blind hero by the name of Daredevil who makes his vision by his excellent hearing. The movie is over the top R rated fun. Jennifer Garner is hot, Duncan is funny and Ferrell is awesome and violent. This movie is so boring to normal man and so much fun to Marvel fans. Critics aren't Marvel fans. Daredevil is so awesome you will cry. It's corny fun. What we want! The guns are used and the blood is shed. Watch the UNRATED version! (If You Dare!) every actor nails it in this film and the pacing is good as well. It's a 7/10 movie for sure. Nothing less nothing more.
7	Real guilty pleasure movie for me, just enjoy the movie for being so, Different, at the time of release it had to go up against the amazing spiderman 2 so, good job for being fun and mindless, this being the main reason why i love the film. The character of Daredevil is very hard to portray and i believe the film did a pretty decent job. 7/10
3	Daredevil embodies what not to do in a superhero movie. Have cheesy one-liners, convoluted plot and a Director who claims all the best scenes were removed in post. Overall not badly shot, but everything else stinks.
10	Daredevil is an excellent marvel comic and superhero movie. The movie received a lot of flak when it was released. I don't see why, the movie is terrific. From the acting to the special effects, the movie hits the mark. Daredevil deserves the utmost kudos for staying true to the dark themes of the comic book. Daredevil and The Punisher are the truest movies to the comic books and they both received low reviews. The reviews mean nothing because both of the movies are magnificent. Both movies are 100 percent true to the marvel comics, A+ for both movies.
3	A solid performance from Ben Affleck and Garner can't withstand the whole 2 hours of noisy soundtrack and mostly bland acting. A disappointing super-hero movie.
10	Un ottimo film,personalmente mi Ã¨ piaciuto veramente tanto.Una storia ben fatta,un cast spettacolare ed un ottima recitazione,mi Ã¨ piaciuto tanto anche perchÃ¨ sono un fan del fumetto di Daredevil e adoro Ben Affleck e Jennifer Garner.
4	Sem sombra de dÃºvidas um dos piores filmes jÃ¡ produzidos da Marvel,nÃ£o sÃ£o os atores Affleck,Farrell,Garner e Clarke Duncan estÃ£o excelentes,destaque ainda mais para performance de Colin Farrell,o problema Ã© a idÃ©ia de colocarem na maioria cenas bestas sem aÃ§Ã£o e sem vida no filme,mas destaques as cenas do Demolidor Vs Elektra,chefÃ£o e Collin sÃ£o as Ãºnicas que prestam.
3	Daredevil couldâ€™ve been a good film. The set up was decent and the visual style was intriguing but the film quickly throws away its potential after the first act. The film glosses over Daredevilâ€™s origin, which couldâ€™ve been a film onto itself and fleshed out the protagonist but the film just skips to him being Daredevil so he can fight the Kingpin. Michael Clarke Duncan does the best he can has the villain and provides one of the more entertaining performances of the film but its not enough. The film is way too goofy at times and his henchman Bullseye along with Eletrika along with some bizarre choices in filming, editing, and scoring. The cast assembled here is good and fine but while they try to give the best performances they can they have been handed a terrible script. Daredevil isnâ€™t the worst comicbook movie ever but its still bad providing a forgettable film that you could honestly skip, which is a shame considering how fascinating this character is in the comics. Hopefully the upcoming Netflix series will make up for it.
2	bumblehawk gave this movie a "10" and puts this in his review. "Here is a man who saw his chance at the beginning of World War II and moved to Nazi-occupied Poland to open a factory and employ Jews at starvation wages. His goal was to become a millionaire. By the end of the war, he had risked his life and spent his fortune to save those Jews and had defrauded the Nazis for months with a munitions factory that never produced a single usable shell. " really i saw Shindlers list also :) Movie was ok but lived nothing up to the hype it received after 2 years of hearing about it i'm glad its finally out. glorified mommy porn on the big screen now.
0	This film is an embarrassment to women, not at all what I thought it was supposed to portray from the media hype. It's a movie about one mousey girl who falls for a sociopath billionaire in Munchausen's fashion. Nothing to do with the girl actually enjoying sex; a massive step backwards for women getting what they want sexually from and with a partner.
10	**************************************************************spoiler alert***************************************************************** its coll
10	I loved the movie, i love the cast, there were several parts of the book missed out but they can't include everything!!. It is so well done and i can't wait to watch the sequels.
10	The movie was good but not great. And here is why. If you haven't read the books â€“ I would not recommend seeing the movie. I really couldn't understand how someone could understand what was going on. I think Dakota Johnson did spot on job and very much portrayed the Anastasia "Ana" like the books. I think Jamie Dornan did a good job with the material that he had. I think that his mysterious aura, past demons and a deeper understanding of him is revealed in book 2. My only disappointment I do think that certain parts of the movie there was opportunities to fly a few more sparks. Positive, I was pleasantly surprised that there was quite a bit of wit and humor. I read the trilogy three times and understood there is no way to show the complete story (1501 pages) in a two-hour film. So, a lot people didn't understand that the movie was ONLY PART 1. So right when you were starting to get into the movie, it pretty much ended abruptly, and the screen went black. It should of stated at that time Part 2 Fifty Shades Darker coming in 2016. Universal has thankfully hired a new screenwriter for part 2. I'm excited about that because book 2 really gets into the guts of the story the characters and why Christian Grey is the way he is.
8	I have not read the book but really enjoyed the film. It has a bit of everything; glamour, humour and sex. It was short and easy to watch. The cast is understated but HOT which made it all the better for me. I am looking forward to seeing the next part. Highly recommended!
1	"Boring (Two Hours that Feel Like Two Weeks- the movie is too LOOOONG), Derivative (The Story of O and 9 1/2 Weeks both did it much better, and with a better-looking cast, if this S & M genre is your thing) and Embarrassingly Stupid, 50SOG is Dreck for Those Whose Brains Have Been Scooped Out" You would have had to have your brain scooped out to buy into the absurd premise that this boring, monotonous, derivative, cheesy-porno dreck has anything to do with love, or even satisfactory coupling. If you manage to make it through the movie without nodding off at the tedium or just cutting your losses and leaving early, you will understand why the distributors and their media enablers had to promote the heck out of this dog to get people into the theatres. The record that 50SOG should be setting is "the year's biggest gotcha." What a bunch of hype for a zero of a movie. The thin storyline is nothing new. To reduce it to its basics and give nothing away that you probably have not already surmised just from the trailer and the heavy hype leading up to its release: Sicko beats up Flavor of the Moment and she pretends to enjoy it in exchange for access to Sicko's money and trappings, natch. Charming, huh? A romantic Valentine story? Not and not. Tinsel Town has reached another low in this stinker of a movie with its fake flagellations, man-on-woman violence and gratuitous sex. About the best that can be said is that at least you get to sit in a theatre seat out of the winter cold for two hours, and you do have two hours of escapism where you do not have to consider the day's beheadings by the Islamic terrorists steadily expanding their already-New Hampshire-sized territory. 50SOG is pretty much devoid of imagination: If this S & M genre is your thing, the oldie The Story of O, or even 9 1/2 Weeks, is not as tedious as this movie is, and those casts are better-looking and better actors. Older filmgoers might also vaguely equate the lack of merit in 50SOG with the icky, degrading Last Tango in Paris: Maria, the butter. Ana baby, the whip. Hollywood cannot seem to "discipline" itself to avoid these irresponsible and degrading themes. Obviously, 50SOG is unapologetically anti-woman and pro-sexual-violence, and generations of women with any sense of history or context (and critical thinking skills surpassing those of a second grader - and let us not forget that most second graders would have a keener sense of stranger danger than apparently the stupid Ana does) are hurling in their popcorn to think that any moviegoers, particularly the confused women who have fueled the success of this dud in both book and now movie form, mistake sexual assault and battery with love, romance or satisfactory coupling. Sexual abuse is not love. Abuse is not cute, not clever, not cool, not fun, not funny, not entertaining. Abuse is sick and an offense. Where is the PC Police when you really need them? The US film industry must be pretty dead, too, if Melanie Griffith's daughter could not get better work than this merde, given her connections. Bottom line, as is obvious from my opinion as expressed in this review, and which also seems to be the 186 to 132 majority view of reviewers on this thread: Save your time and money for a good movie, as 50SOG stinks. About the only reason to waste your time with this dog is if it is a cold day and you need a place to get in out of the elements for two (long) hours and you only have $14 in your pocket. Otherwise, stay clear.- La Mer Rating: One half of one star out of five stars.
10	It was great, loved it, Jamie and Dakota were completely fantastic. It was a great book to film adaptation, and i cannot wait for Fifty Shades Darker.
10	let me start by saying i loved this film ! i went in with a real open mind i did expect the sex to be vary corny and just stupid like a porno but hands down you did a brilliant job of them when you watch the sex scenes you sorta think why isnt my sex life that good ! i loved the movie ! i cant wait for the next one !!!! second of all to all the people out there that are saying it abuse just sit down and shut up coz i can tell you from experiences or abuse its not ! and its really offensive that you are saying that ! this film is brilliant !
4	"Fifty Shades" is not a romantic movie, is the movie the abuse of female, when sexual violence become pleasure . The action is boring, chemistry between two actors in the leading role demonstrate not implication and embarrassed (the scene in bath). The story presented in movie is not realistic, the scenario is very simple. The movie relatively respect the book. The book is extremely pornographic but exist chemistry between Anastasia and Grey. The movie is not pornographic, is not erotic is boring..... I want to see Jamie Dornan in this role and disapointed because he's not represented in this role.
9	This movie blows my mind. First of all, reading the book I could not pass the first chapter. English is not my native language but I went to college and I appreciate sophisticated vocabulary . I could not believe the poor language in the book. I thought a 12 years old have written it so I was not able to read it. The only reason why I went to the theater was that I loved both trailers and the soundtrack and of course all the talking attached to the movie. I went with my girlfriends because my bf totally refused to come with me. To du stride the movie had something magical attached to it. Till this day I can't say what it was because I know this production does not qualify fior an Oscar but there is totally something magical to it. I hardly ever watch the movie fit a second time but I can't wait till it's available on dvd. I want to mention that I was very upset that the movie was qualified as soft porn. Whoever calls it that has no idea what they are talking about. Sex scenes are very tasteful and you don't get see too much of private parts in the movie. It has never been close to a any kind of porn. Also the sex scenes are very brief and not the major plot in the movie. I know for some parts the movie doesn't make sense and makes you wonder what's really going on but it's very aintriguing and pleasant to watch. The music is outstanding and complements the story very well. Overall if you are a romantic female you might love the movie as I do, but if you are a guy expecting sine action you might get really disappointed. Another thing, anyone saying this movie is promoting domestic abuse is out of their mind because everything in the movie is consensual and presented in a really fascinating way. My favorite movie in a while, thumbs up!
10	Sadomasochism is not violence you idiot, go search. A submissive has all the control. She or he sets their limits. A sub tells a dom what they will allow done. A sub says when to stop. And the movie is not about Stalk, surprise is not ilegal, and Ana LOVE all that he does, she never said stop follow me. and it is a single love story, it is not moral lesson, they do right, they do wrong, they are human. It is a UNIQUE Story. Ana is testing her limits. 50 shades isn't a porno. It depicts one man's insecurity and need for control. It shows an inexperienced girl suddenly experiencing all these sensations and emotions. It shows one couple's epic love story, their pain, their lust, and their need for each other. They love each other, and their slowly admitting that to one another. If you can't see that past the physical attraction sex scenes, then you're too young to be reading this series in the first place.
10	Desde a estrÃ©ia do filme baseado no livro Cinquenta Tons de Cinza, que jÃ¡ bateu recorde de bilheteria, tenho acompanhado a reaÃ§Ã£o dos fÃ£s, afinal de contas sÃ£o estes que interessa agradar, nÃ£o haters, e muito menos crÃ­ticos especializados que sempre detonaram a trilogia escrita sem o menor respeito. Quem sustenta qualquer produto sÃ£o as pessoas que gostam. Harry Potter em 10 anos nunca ganhou um Oscar, nem de efeito especial, mudou alguma coisa? CrepÃºsculo por exemplo tem 50 milhÃµes de seguidores no Facebook, e sempre foi massacrado. Pois ebtÃ£o, serÃ¡ que eles (esmagadora maioria elas) gostaram do filme? A resposta Ã© que 90% sim, adorou, mas sem deixar de fazer ressalvas. Muito se falou que o filme Ã© muito resumido, corta muita coisa do livro e tem cenas de sexo mais leves, mas a grande maioria dos fÃ£s tambÃ©m entendem bem, como funciona uma adaptaÃ§Ã£o para o cinema, e que isso Ã© normal. A fidelidade do filme foi muito elogiada, o que era esperado, uma vez que a autora sempre esteve dando pitacos e decidindo detalhes nos bastidores da produÃ§Ã£o. A maior negatividade em comentÃ¡rios que encontrei, foi quando as paginas oficiais do livro e filme sugeriam um relacionamento com o Sr. Grey, o que mostra que o sadomasoquismo assusta muitas pessoas, e algumas desinformadas chegam a achar que se trata de violÃªncia, mas Ã© minoria.
10	Fan LOVED the film, what more matter? Critics? Haters? NO! They don't represent all the success that movie already is. Everybody that make a movie needs fans and people that enjoy what you do, and about this, book and movie has.
4	I wouldn't say horrible,cos I'm a big fan of the book and the story,but I expected something better.They missed out the most important thing from the movie. The passion.The book is full with passion,that's why its good.I felt the movie dry and empty.I'm quite disappointed.
3	I watched 50 Shades of Grey last night. I gave it 2 stars out of 5! Yes, I read the book, so I think that played into my underwhelming experience, but it was REALLY bad. Every single character in this film was one-dimensional. They all felt like props, placed in a film simply to tell one simplified story. And that story kept going and going and going. No sub plots, just one. I liked the book, but I think the execution majorly fell apart in film. Some say it had entertainment value. I thought most of the raunchy scenes were strangely disjointed. I mean, were they meant to make you laugh, or get hot? I couldn't tell. Ugh.
1	orginally i was relieved that it didn't seem to be like the book....but there will just be a sequel that is more fetishy......honestly i thought this movie came out like a year ago......whats funny is that i was ready for a witch burning and its nothing compared to stoker...as far as getting girls to spluge to violence/evil....
0	Extremely tasteless, empty and vulgar, for a primitive viewer, exceptionally bad story or simply no story at all, bad screenplay, bad everything, even bad soft porno, I was driving home and thinking about â€œPretty Womanâ€?, or â€œThomas Crown Affairâ€¦..
2	As guilty as I feel to admit this, I did read the book prior to seeing this (curiosity and the hype got the better of me.) By then, I felt obligated to see this simply because I'd read the book. All I can really say on this one is that it was a HUGE waste of time! The film's R-rating pretty much meant that it would have to be tamed way down compared to the book. Sure enough, it was, and the final result isn't that great. The acting was far worse than I originally anticipated. Jamie Dornan needs to pick a better speech coach next time, because I could easily tell the guy's from Ireland since the accent kept slipping through the entire time he talked. Dakota Johnson didn't do much better, as I found myself laughing to myself and the way she delivered her lines and dialogue in some parts. Overall, in the end, all this film really was is a failed attempt to adapt an erotic novel into a film that can only get so erotic due to its R-rating. In addition to that, it's just another reminder of BDSM relationships (and this film completely glorifies it!)
1	I read a 1/4 of the book so I had an idea of what the movie entailed. To me, this was just a different version of Nine and 1/2 Weeks. I thought Anastasia was too unattractive for the part, but played a good innocent type with a dominating side to herself. Christian Grey was cast well. For the most part, the movie was weak and easy to make fun of. It did not turn me on at all. I think this is more for the young and inexperienced in life. I think it's sad when a person has to result in getting tortured to feel fulfilled. Overall, not impressed.
3	As I am not the target audience for fifty shades of grey nor did I read any of the books, I am married to someone who did care to read the books and has now seen the film. As I stated before I did not read the books so I have the added benefit of judging this as just a film rather than judging it as an adaptation. This movie is not atrocious but its not good by any means. This film is all about a relationship, regardless of what they do in there relationship, This is the key factor in this film, the most important part about it. It was this key element that fifty shades of grey lacks. The relationship between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey was not believable at all. The chemistry between the two actors was stiff and unbelievable. Although Dakota's performances was the redeemable quality of this film. It was Jaime's performance that gave the relationship it's stiff and scripted feel. Even though I didn't read the books and I don't know what Christian Grey's character is suppose to be, I still felt his character should have had more presence on the screen, Anastasia up staged him totally when he is suppose to be the dominant one. One of the biggest complaints I heard about the book was how poorly the book was written. This is clearly the case because the script was awful. The dialogue, the story, and most importantly the relationship between Christian and Anastasia. I think this film had the potential to portray this relationship and all it entails with out making an all out smut film, but by having an actor who dominates the screen, as the relationship. Someone with more charisma. Instead it was Anastasia who stole the scenes. I think my biggest problem with this film is the fact it would have been interesting to see this story play out the way it was suppose to. To take this taboo subject and have it reflected in this film. I am going to give fifty shades of grey a 4 out of 10. I recommend this if you have read the books and want to see this play out on the big screen, unfortunately if you liked the book I think your gonna be disappointed. Thanks for reading
3	This is exactly what you would expect from a film based on a book that was initially just a moronic Twilight fan fiction novel. The relationship makes no sense, the basis of the plot makes no sense and it glorifies physical and emotional abuse.
0	Porn, Bad porn. Abused female porn. Aren't we fighting violence against women? This movie glorifies it and tries to make it romantic. It's not romantic , it's just porn, This movie is disgusting. I don'[t get it. Sports figures are being shamed and loosing their jobs and Hollywood is ok with this! Shame on you all. Horrible movie.
6	Dopey but never dull, 50 SHADES OF GREY is way too somber for its own good. Why are these films always so serious? Shouldn't S&M be fun? Or mean and nasty. Something. Luckily, saw this in Spanish in Mexico City which made it far more entertaining than it should be. Dakota Johnson is pretty damn good though. Question: Why does each generation need a story like this? From STORY OF O to 9 1/2 WEEKS to 50 SOMBRAS DE GREY. WHY? Inquiring minds want to know.
8	My thoughts going into the movie after reading the books was that there is no way they would be able to do the sex scenes to the strength of the book, (lets face it books are always better) and they didnt, but it wasnt as weak as I thought it would be. I thought it was a great movie, well done, something we havent seen before, it was thrilling and mysterious! I cant wait for the rest of the series!
2	maybe if I do not read the book, I might like this movie but in my opinion this is a romantic story with maybe two 'hard' moments and don't contain lots of episodes from the book. I like watching romantic movies but this is not what I expected. I give three because Ana's jokes were funny and Jamie is really hot guy but after reading a book it DID NOT rapture me.
10	loved this film i don't understand how people can say its domestic violence and rape! has no one seen or heard of bdsm? or do u just not understand it?
7	I went to the movies last night waiting for a bad movie, and then went home surprised it was better than I expected. This isn't a remarkable movie, but it's fun enough. Dakota is really sexy and she portrayed the artsy nerd really well. Dornan was good, but less convincing than her. I think Jonathan Rhys Myers, for instance, would suit better for job. Anyway, it's a good movie. It's more romance than pure sex.
9	I enjoyed the movie and i thought it was great. It's not a sex movie like everyone says it is as there is a love story to it. The sex scenes are not pornographic. If people enjoyed The Wolf of Wall Street, which shows a great deal of sex scenes; then they should enjoy Fifty Shades. I did not expect the movie to be like the book and glad it wasn't, because then it would ruin the excitement of reading the book and using your own imagination. Sam Taylor-Johnson and the actors did a great job and I'm looking forward to watching parts 2 and 3.
3	I've read the book. The first one. I wasn't impressed. I didn't appreciate the writing, so I wasn't expecting much from the screen version either. I'm glad, however, that I read the book before. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have a clue about what's going on besides sex and obsession. There were way too many plot holes for me, like what is Grey's Enterprises? Do they sell stocks? Do they secretly push drugs and cover themselves as an impressive building that's an entire city block? What? I still don't know, as a viewer and not a reader. From the standpoint of a film student, having techniques and all ingrained into my mind, I do give this movie a star on cinematography, because I did appreciate it. Some of the set lighting was curiously put, but it worked. I didn't like the acting. It was awkward. Not a spark of chemistry for me between Dorman and Johnson. There wasn't enough background for me either. This was really just a mess, and the sex made its money back. I didn't have much for this movie at all. Oh, but the soundtrack was really good, and excellently used.
0	Not enough sex. not kinky enough over all not porno enough. asfdssssssssfhgdsdafhkasdgskajdgsajgfdjasfkjasbcsajkhfsahfjkasbckjasbfkbasfbaskjfbaskhfsakfhasf
0	OMG. What's with all the hype with this movie??? This movie sucks ass! This movie is probably for horny teenagers or single people? Definitely not for married people. I'm beyond disappointed. My husband and I gave up watching it after 50 minutes into the movie. ï»¿
0	Jamie dornan thinks he is in a catwalk . His woodenness beyond words and absolutely no chemistry with Dakota Johnson .The story smells of staleness . We have seen the same film many times for example 9,5 weeks, secretary as far as the nudity goes nine songs and lie with me were much better. Adaptation of this popular book sadly delivers a big nothing. There isn't even a good love scene for Gods sake
10	To address a lot of the reviews stating this is glossed over domestic abuse, I have been in a relationship that was abusive to the point of having my bones broken and being emotionally and mentally terrorized. This movie is NOTHING like an abusive relationship and doesn't in any way "teach" women to stay in abusive relationships. It does however teach you to play with your partner safely, sanely and consensually. Anastasia was given a contract to go through, pages and pages of things to agree to or turn down, on top of being reminded often she could safe word out of any activity, she was really the one in control the entire time as all submissives are in the lifestyle. Now on to the rest of it. Anastasia desperate need to be loved, accepted, wanted...how much she wanted to love him, please him, heal him and his hurt and anguish, all those emotions flying around, filling up the space between them, I felt like I was drowning in it, like...i couldnt see past the need to be loved that she felt. The connection emotionally between the two stole the entire movie for me. I barely even registered the BDSM play aspects at all I was so caught up in the emotional roller coaster between Anastasia and Christian. The sadness when those elevator doors closed at the end from them both was palpable. I really hope they do end up making the other movies and I truly hope the connection between the characters isn't lost along the way if different writers or directors are brought in.
0	Pathetic and absurd, disgusting and gross, wrong on so many levels and yet people still go out to watch it. A movie for people with mental issues especially women
9	After all the bad reviews I expected thw worst, I think the movie is actually really good. the actors, the music and the plot was clear. wowwwww I just read that grey's wife is angry heeeheeee
1	Terrible, just terrible. I tried to give it a chance, but honestly, I thought the book was horrible, so how could I expect much more from the movie version? Dakota Johnson wasn't half bad as Ana, but Jamie Dornan was terrible and had no expression on his face throughout the movie. The music was cheesy and the dialogue laughable. The sex was really clinical and the leads had zero chemistry. There was no passion, no spark, nothing. Suffice it to say after this bad experience I'm not going to see the sequel.
10	I just love this movie, ans the actors! Me encanto la pelicula, ya quiero ver la segunda parte. Buenas actuaciones, mostraron lo mas importante del libro.
0	This is a movie about nothing. I left the cinema and I've asked myself, what it is all about? There is no plot, just a guy dating a girl like we see in every movie as a subplot. This movie has only the subplot. The trailer you see is the movie itself. For those who want some hot action, sorry but there is none, just some kissing scenes and romance, and they're so poor(not even closer to those 90's soft porn). I swear, there is no sex scene and the dude does not even use all the spanking stuff he has there. When he beats her with 6 whippings(camera on dude's face, then SLAP!, then girl's face), the movie is over.
2	I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason. If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldnâ€™t know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time. Itâ€™s not like erotic literature or erotic novels didnâ€™t exist before E.L. Jamesâ€™ novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism. Iâ€™m not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screenwriting and acting skills, you canâ€™t do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the filmâ€™s production. Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kateâ€™s (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaperâ€™s article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it. Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasnâ€™t meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself? The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days? Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday peopleâ€™s lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentineâ€™s Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of â€˜loveâ€™ for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?
10	1000000000000000000000000000 with love me like you do in your soundtrack. i'm addicted in this music, is perfect, and the film is cool, only ...............
10	I love this movie! For the past two days i watched it 3 times.. cant wait to see next part. Well done Sam Taylor-Johnson and of course Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, - it was such a pleasure to watch how they ask! My score - 10
2	To little surprise, Fifty Shades managed to better than the book, but that's only a very flimsy consolation, given the extreme poorness of the source material. Everything else is rubbish from the acting to the screenplay. Casting as well, since pretty much nobody (girls included) thought Jamie Dornan to be a good choice. It only sometimes gets saved by some beautiful shots of Seattle, which suit better an ad than a movie. This film was driven by marketing (as it was bound, to be fair) and I think it was made to appeal to women only. And only to some women, even, specifically girls just old enough to get permission to see this. The R rating is bloated - a couple of swear words and full frontal nudity do not make this movie explicit at all - which was the one thing that one could like about the book. Furthermore, not only it's not explicit, it's also not erotic. This is what happens when: 1) Producers know that the movie is going to be a financial success before they even start shooting it; 2) Your source material is awful. 3) You change an appallingly written story whose only appeal is the erotica in it, and you make it tame. To specify: I don't judge the content of this movie or of the book. Erotica is fine and it can be as explicit as you wish. What I'm criticising is the mentality behind the corny dialogues and the number of awful choices that were made , which reflect in the film and make it totally uninteresting.
5	The movie you have to know the importance of time and money. If you want to the erotic, look at the porn that will get better It's serious advices! Remember that.!!!
1	Stupid, with amazingly dull script and boring story. If you're into bondage, you will enjoy some internet sites much more than this wannabe erotic drama. Really not worth anyone's time. 1/10
0	As a girl I expected this to be a nice movie. It just isn't. It's boring and with no story at all. Avoid at all cost cause only thing I wanted to tie after this movie is a noose around my neck.
4	If Iâ€™m being honest, I should be damning the Fifty Shades film to hell. Itâ€™s an adaption of one of the most poorly written novels in recent memory and makes the Twilight trilogyâ€™s Stephanie Meyersâ€”which it initially originated from, being a fan fictionâ€”look like J.D. Salinger. Itâ€™s also one of the poorest representations of the BDSM community Iâ€™ve ever witnessed and Iâ€™d argue that itâ€™s actually about a mentally unstable man who uses â€œBDSMâ€? to stabilize his sadist mindâ€”if I took â€œeroticâ€? fan fiction seriously. But Fifty Shades of Grey just wasnâ€™t as unwatchable as I initially predicted it to be and, to my surprise, it has entertainment valueâ€”if not in its target audience, it has laughable dialogue, cheap acting performances, and an overall sense of silliness, the way it boasts the fetish it knows nothing of, which should make it a must-see for the ones who antagonize it most. But otherwise, this isnâ€™t a film I wouldnâ€™t particularly remember, for better or worse, if it werenâ€™t for the controversy, criticism and cultural criticism surrounding it. Itâ€™s merely a mediocrity dressed in clothing that might catch everyoneâ€™s attention, both good and bad, but some of us who neither treasure nor hate this franchise see how unfitting it truly is.
2	Two words......SEVERELY UNDERWHELMING. The plot and the concept were good (there is a concept, you must analyze and understand), but it totally failed to deliver the excitement and the adrenaline an erotic romantic should possess. Aside from that, it also failed to deliver the technical excellence. The scenes that must be highlighted were cut too short, the dialogue was bad, the acting of the supporting cast was bad, and a lot more. It all gone wrong, which is such a shame
9	Loved it but Could have been 20 minutes shorter as it was a little slow in part. I assume that was to make us feel like the female longing for more. I think the bad reviews are from people who dont understand the people drawn to that life style. Lisa Wilkinson proves her ignorance on understanding the character Dakota plays. And the lead male is not a jerk... he is a product of abuse grooming and Lisa doesn't even see that... How rude and ignorant can people be. Human behaviour is fascinating study. Well done!
6	It really wasn't as bad as some are saying. For reference I am a guy who dislikes chick flicks, but I like indie artsy types of films, so I guess my 6/10 makes sense. Also, I did not read the books and you don't need to have read them to watch or understand or even enjoy the film. I enjoyed some parts of it, some parts were a little boring, but honestly, most of the time Mr. Grey and the girl were on screen together it was pretty interesting and captured my attention. It was not a bad film. Some of the dialogue however was bad, so bad that it made me laugh. But the guys character is supposed to be stiff, so it works. Mainly though, in terms of the sex, if you have seen a single porn in your life then it wont be anything even remotely shocking. The sex was very PG, and it was much more about foreplay, or whatever it is that women like and think about so much. That was basically the whole point of the film was some kind of long drawn out sexual foreplay. But without even much sex. It was however interesting for as long as he was on screen, and when he was not I started to get bored momentarily...(they are on screen together most of the film though.) 6/10, it was OK. Really no reason to get excited unless you are a middle aged woman, or uptight about sex.
2	Cheesy, cringe-worthy dialogue. Wooden, robotic performance by Jamie Dornan, who lacked the intensity and charisma needed to pull off the character. Dakota Johnson was ok, and had a charm to her but had no chemistry with the other lead. Awful, unsatisfying ending.
9	Generally people don't like this book, nor the characters or movie. Though most don't get how BDSM works. While I'm new to this series, it seems that the author at least somewhat gets how it works.
2	My question is how can people manage to stay through this piece of **** movie. First of all is not interesting there's nothing special about it's just about a virgin girl that finds this douchebag who has sex with her multiple times. That's pretty much it. Don't even wait for it on DVD. Fifty Shades Of Grey is the worst "love" story ever. Pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen. Watch the notebook as many times and when you're tired of it than that's how you would feel about this crap.
8	I almost did not want to watch the movie because I know it is almost impossible to capture the essence of this or any other book on film. I did, however, enjoy the movie. I think the actors portrayed the characters well and told the love story that the book is about....not the sex. When reading the book, the imagination is free to run wild and yes it is much more erotic than the film. I hated the ending as I hated the ending to the first book because it just makes you long for more.... So I immediately started to reread the 2nd book. Can't wait for the sequel.
6	Yes, we have here a poorly developed story, with some dialogues that are ridiculous and supporting characters who are totally wasted. Jamie Dornan has the phisicality that Grey demanded but he doesn't have the attitude this role required. On the other hand, Johnson made an adaptation that has a stunning soundtrack, great sex scenes and Dakota gives a perfect performance as Anastasia. For fans this will be awesome and even for people who didn't read read the books this can be an interesting entertainment. It's the classical love story we all know to be honest.
0	Fifty Shades of Grey more like Fifty Shades of Abuse. The story is about a literature student, interviews the wealthy, intimidating Christian Grey and instantly develops an attraction to the enigmatic man. Grey is likewise drawn to Ana - but will only agree to a relationship on his own terms. Both will discover a place where want and desire intersect. Fifty Shades of Grey was a movie that I had zone interested in, because I was in that bad mood where if I see a best selling novel being made into a movie which is a cliche now, and now there did it with Fifty Shades of Grey which by the way the book sucked ass, yeah I red the book and I had no idea why it was a best seller it's basically porn on paper. What's more annoying is in the UK there are people on the Radio and everyone I met who was looking forward to this movie and my Question is why. The people on the Radio keep making top stories about it making it the hot headline and I'm here thinking "That's really new worthy. There's loads of usual but amazing things happening around the world and this peace of **** makes the headline. My hope for humility is slowly fading away". And that's not all, I'm not kidding you here but there actually made a headline of it's reviews it's getting and this never happened before when it comes to movies. So after seeing Fifty Shades of Grey I can say it's not as bad as people say, it's actually a lot worse then I thought. Now let me give you the positive things in this movie: Dakota Johnson was the only good actress in this movie, she did what she can do with a god awful script that she had and shes the only one in this movie that gives it her all. The movie is shot really good as well, it fitted the movie very well, but beside's that all those good things can't hind the fact that this is a abomination against humanity, it brings shame to cinema and it should be burn in hell. Now let's talk about Mr. Grey The Psychopath, now I got to ask you this what do women see in this guy, I mean his not charming at all, his cold, he's kind of a **** and what he want's to do is hurt you with sex, and the actor himself isn't really that good at all. And she doesn't enjoy it she only does it to make him feel good so in the sex scenes she's not enjoying it, she's getting hurt by this guy and after a while she get's crossed with him and then she runs off then start's to have thoughts about him and how she needs a man in her life so she goes back. The writing in this movie I don't know if it's for comic relief or to be taken seriously, because the writing in this movie was absolutely atrocious and it's the most cheesiest dialogue ever put to film, it's Twilight dialogue bad. Now is this worse than Twilight and I can't believe I'm saying this but yes it is. I found a movie that's more awful and more laughable than Twilight. I hated this movie, I hated it, I HATED IT, I HATED IT. This is the worst movie of 2015, I can't wait to forget this film. You better off seeing Kingsman: The Secret Service, I haven't see it myself yet but at least that movie looks well made and effort went into it.
1	All it has is sex no real story its a terrible movie that should not be supported IMO Don't let the popularity and advertisement of this film fool you, because this film is bad. It's not even bad - it's atrocious. With little 'erotic' behavior and a whole lot of caked over domestic violence, this movie is not only bad in the sense of story and bad acting, but teaches women to stay in abusive relationships.
5	"Fifty Shades of Grey" is nothing more than a joke of a film but if you put aside ridiculous characters and unrealistic scenarios, it isn't that bad of a film. The film lacks passion, love and sex, not a good combo if the name of the movie is "Fifty Shades of Grey".
0	Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more? Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more? Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more? Twilight fan-fiction.. need I say more?
0	ABSOLUTE, 100% GARBAGE... NO ACTING SKILLS WHATSOEVER, EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE SUCKS HARD..ANA PLS SUCK A BIG DICK NEXT TIME YOU **** UNTALENTED ****
10	I've seen alot of porn & less drama, but... awh hell... In theaters (after they left with their wife/girlfriend). People got f--king spooked & (awh hell whatever word that it fit to say). They going home and do their dirty stuff (don't bother asking me :( ) Honestly, It's not a perfect valentine movies, but full of people wanna watch Dakota 8008S when Dornan f--ed her, & smack her in the a--hole. But awh hell... :(
6	I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I read a bunch of reviews on it from other users and pro critics that gave the movie a bad rap, but again, I was pleasantly surprised. Now hold it before you start flaming me and **** because that's what the internet does just hear me out. A: A movie isn't bad because there is a lack of consent. That doesn't make a bad movie. Sure it makes a bad moral, doesn't give the right message, may encourage people, but that does NOT MAKE A BAD MOVIE. B: She does give consent, just not written. At the graduation scene she says OK to his request. Yes he perused her, but how many movies does the guy peruse the girl or vise versa? What makes this movie different? Just because they have explicit sex scenes in it? C: BDSM is OK. Personally, I do not like it. Does that mean whips, sticks, belts, rope, blindfolding, and gags are gross, horrifying, and disgusting? Of course! To me at least. People are into that kind of thing is a kink, and kink is wonderful. Hell people don't like my kinks or fetishes, some of which would be gross, horrifying, and disgusting to most people but that's peoples' kinks and there is nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it, that's not the movie's problem. It's yours, and why should the movie conform to your opinions? A movie is there to entertain you, and if you are not entertained by BDSM, then watch another movie, nobody is stopping you. There isn't a guy at the exit saying, "You paid for this movie so that mean's you can't leave." D: This isn't a **** dating movie. If I wanted to have an erotic time with my partner, I wouldn't want to have it in a theatre with a big sweaty guy with a box of milk duds sitting next to me. That, and I don't watch sex scenes with my partner because that's not what I'm into. Now that my rant is aside, the movie overall was a bit more than alright (that's a 5). The plot was surprisingly deep, showing us what a lack of communication can lead to. It also explores detrimental child abuse, the lack of two people not being able to mesh but have a deep infatuation with each other, a first relationship, and most importantly, how far can a relationship go when it's just based off of looks. It's quite emotional at parts as you feel either empathy/hatred for Grey or Anastasia. That's probably about the driving point of the film itself. The cinematography was good for the most part, scenery was great the whole way through, writing was... eh, and I'm sure glad it was a good adaptation and they didn't go strictly by the book. The only big problem I had was the acting. Not that it was all bad, but the contrast in quality between a good female role and a bad male role threw me off. Overall: a bit over a bogie, but not yet par.
0	Worst movie I think I've ever seen. Boring, slow, and uneventful. Even the "sex" scenes were boring, and that was that bad. There was no chemistry, and the movie ended before anything interesting could happen. It might have been alright if they cut an hour from the movie of useless garbage, moved it along at a much faster pace, hired some actors that could make someone believe they have some sort of feeling, and put a proper ending to the movie.
0	some body say this is a love story!!!! I don't think so. love not like this!! this is sexual dreams of the author...with this movie we see fall of the Cinema... oh **** cinema is dying help...
4	I've watched this movie and had no good expectations about it, because always something so popular becomes in a very bad movie, the dialogues were awful, it was too slow, but i was really impressed with dakota, she was one of the few things that highlights of this movie
2	The movie was so bad and confusing. I haven't read the book before but by watching the movie, that is not appealing and not what I've expected before. Heard people say that the books are more interesting so I bought the trilogy.
5	To be honest, I haven't read the book. So as you can see, the following will be just a vision created by what can be extracted from the movie itself: I gave it a mixed score because I considered it that way, such as if you have 0.5 and want to approximate it and the result gets to be 1. The actors are good, just that; they show failures and tend to overact, but, due to the film characteristics, that's just the minimal necessity for it. Now, what's important: the movie itself. The proposal its interesting and the exposure given to the viewers its creative; you don't usually see BDSM practice in movies, and even more, to be "socially" accepted. But that's not the principal thematic about the movie, the problem is that it gets to show hypocrisy. We have this "relationship" between Anastasia and Christian where he wants her to fit his profile and she tries to adapt to it, but it never gets fulfilled; there is always some sort of resistance between both, and mostly coming from Steele (which I find actually pretty funny), where she always plays with him, due to the intention from his to be "dominant over the submissive" but her intention is not to give in easily; that's the biggest problem and inconvenient coming from the film. They sell the movie as the "romantic story" which is in the dreams of every teenager fan of the book: Christian Grey plays with Anastasia Steele in order to obtain pleasure and satisfaction, but as the end of the movie exposes, if you retire the satisfaction from the act, then this one becomes hollow*, such as the movie. *Yes! The Imitation Game.
5	All I'm saying is that I'm disappointed film. I was expecting something else entirely I, don't know why but I had a much better impression for this movie.
2	Not worth the hype it was like watching a lifetime flick. Brokeback was way more powerful in all areas of grit controversy and hardcore sex and drama. This is a commercial for rich prick travel guide. I actually thought I might have been teleported to Saudi Arabia for this much censorship in a marketed R-rated film I thought. Wow cringe worthy the amount of censorship in this day. Also bad thy dead eyes of Christian Grey and what's her face.
3	Based on a book that reads as though it was written by a sex starved teenager who failed English, the film didn't have a lot to live up to. The fact that it is even passably watchable is in no small part to Taylor-Wood's direction and a half decent performance from Johnson, but the rest of this debacle is almost unwatchable, unless you want to watch it ironically and view it as a comedy. Possibly the least sexy film about sex ever made.
2	Haven't wanted to walk out on a film since "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers". I couldn't do that at this film since I was on a date, thus compounding my suffering. No story, no character development, no resolution, and grade school dialog make this the loser film of the year. Before I even said a thing after the ending, my date apologized for dragging me out to this atrocity. This sums it up: Let's write a novel about every girl's fantasy unicorn of a man, include an S&M component to add an aspect of taboo in order to pique more interest, then start a viral marketing campaign to get people to talk about the novel. This'll cause everyone to read it to see what the big deal is. When they find out there's no big deal, they'll be asking everyone else, what the big deal was, spiraling the virality of the novel. And then of course, capitalize on the commercial success of this marketing ploy by making a film on the cheap and let the viral aspect do all the marketing of the film for you. Final step, use your Benji's from novel/film profits to light up your contraband Cubans whilst bathing in champagne.
5	Sinceramente , filme completamente sem nexo , muitas pessoas dizendo sobre as cenas de nudez e explicita , mas nada supre a filma de roteirismo desse filme , o que foi esse final ? pelo amor de Deus , vamos melhorar isso , dou 5 porque algumas partes ficaram normalizadas e dentro do contexto.

8	I really enjoyed this movie. It made sense to me and I saw a beautiful love story as well as a very trouble man and the woman that loved him. I saw how people think differently about the topic of the movie. Some see this movie as brutal I saw it more as a trouble person and a love story.
3	BIG FAMOUS BEST SELLING BOOK... terrible money making movie. This movie was created only to make money since the book became famous because of its erotic clasification and a controversial BDSM related themes. I've read the books and after seen the movie, I was very disapointed, the MOST important thing about this book is every thought Anastasia had about Grey and BDSM, in this movie you cant get to know what is going on in her mind. You can interpret that she doesnt like the way he is or the way he treats her, but she still got into BDSM practices, and the important WHY she did it, its totally missing. To make this movie even worse, one of the things that people critizised about the book, is that BDSM is practiced by people with psychological problems, people that need help, people that are sick... and once again this movie fails into proyecting this same way of seen Grey as a sick person. Bad sex scenes, failure in thansmiting the main ideas of the bdsm and Anastasias thoughts, and TERRBLE performance of the principal character Christian Grey, in the movie he looks like an idiot, VERY different form the book. Dont waste your time watching this movie, I know many people dont like to read, but believe me, if you want to know what the fifty shades are all about, you better read the books.
1	A useless attempt to raise up another imbecile badly-made, two-part finale series book adaptation. The performances by Johnson and Dorian look forced therefore crappy. The sequence of events was intrepidly stupid. The Script? By far, one of the worsely written scripts I have seen in my life. The dialogue was cheesy and full of animalistic clichÃ©s. The only thing I can call "slightly good" is the way the film is shot and the music used. Overall, it's not worth of your money.
10	This is Perfect, Love Jamie and Dakota. Despite having highly summarized the book, loved the way they gave life to the film, putting a little comedy, changing a few lines in the book are kind of unnecessary. I hope that as a result, more explore the book and change some lines pq sound kind of strange. I want to see Rita Ora appear more beautiful she is, Kate, Grace, Eliot. Also want to see who will be the Robinson and Jackie lady. Anxious for the next movies.
3	No problem that I have with the abuse or whatever you call it cuz I don't.. But what's up with the end of the movie?! Seriously, after all these discoveries and figuring what Grey's life is like, Ana has JUST felt upset ?!? Or she has only lost appetite ?
6	Not as bas as I thought and yet not as good as promoted. Though the subjet of the movie and books deals with a complex theme of Master-servant relationship which is not usually comprehended by most therefore people are misleaded to a wrong and superficial analysis of the movie, misinterpreting the whole thing.
9	I actually really enjoyed this film, doesnt quite live up to the book and what that leads you to imagine, but has its own twist on the writers words without leaning towards a porno, which lets face it a lot of people were expecting.
6	A fake gay man who is living his sick sexual fantasies. Spanking as new sex rage A movie at the speed of the 30 KM/hour zone Actually a very smooth and stylish movie for the late hours, romance, love. Great soundtrack
10	I am surprised I actually loved this movie. I thought the characters were great and the actors portrayed and connected with their characters as portrayed in the book. I feel the hype in the media and all the negativity is ridiculous. People are being way to critical. It is fiction. It is entertainment. I hope there are the sequels as in the trilogy. It is a bit unnerving that some key scenes were left out and maybe the negative critics should read the book and connect the dots.
0	holy. **** **** I dont even know if i can give a negative 10 stars, but if there was a option for that then id choose it.

Okay sorry, im really done know.
3	Watched it sometime ago it appeared to me as a nice movie at first but soon came the reality and all my focus moved on the acting and it was disappointing on the side of character "Christian Grey" played by "Jamie Dornan" while "Dakota Johnson" who played the character of "Anastasia Steele" quite okay overall because of the explicit scenes the movie was scored on the other hand there were a few moments worth remembering in the movie, at the end it appeared to me as waste of time, music given by various artists in the movie is all i remember.
1	â€œFifty Shades of Grey Reviewâ€? So for the second time, I just finished watching this movie and...wow, just wow. When it comes to a film like this, the question and really the only relevant question that I have is â€œwhat the fecal matter is this?â€? This movie is horrible and I'll cast some light as to the reasons why it's horrible but first let me note a few things. I'm not going to even bother structuring this review. This means making separate sections for â€œPresentationâ€?, â€œCharactersâ€?, â€œMusicâ€?, etc. This movie doesn't deserve that level of time or effort. I'm not going to insult the word â€œspoilerâ€? because this movie doesn't have a plot. I'm not going sit here and write paragraph after paragraph after paragraph explaining in every little small exquisite detail why this movie is bad which I could very well do but considering two hours of my time has already been wasted, I'm not going to stress out my level of patience further. Now onto my tailored and straightforward to the point review of this crap known as Fifty Shades of Grey. First of all, I'm going to be blunt, this movie does not have a plot. I repeat, there is no story in this movie which is understandable because this bull**** is based off a trilogy of books inspired by ******* Twilight. That within of itself says enough and it says enough in spades. The premise for this garbage, and I can't believe I just insulted the word â€œgarbageâ€? is about a young college grad named Anastasia Steele or Anna. Anna goes to interview this young billionaire, that's right â€œBillionaireâ€?, pretty boy, named Christian Grey. Christian just after one interview almost immediately becomes a stalker and with enough persistence, he and Anna elope in this one sided relationship which involves her becoming his sex slave. After about an hour and fifty minutes of nothing, Anna finally decides to grow a brain and she considers the relationship to be abusive despite the fact that it was an abusive relationship from the start and this was explained to her by Christian himself exactly what this was going to be early on in the movie. So, Anna decides to leave Christian and the movie ends. Cut to black, begin end credits. â€¦Yeah, that's the movie. And as a word of some positivity, Dakota Johnson wasn't too bad in this. She did inject some humor into her lifeless character but she nor anyone else is saving this film right here. So what's the problem with the movie? Many things, the first being the way this was marketed. Fifty Shades of Grey was marketed to be this soft-core pornographic film being toted as a serious movie. In that regard alone, this is somewhat okay considering other films such as Secretary have done the same and have done this a lot better but that's for another discussion. The problem with Fifty Shades in this regard is the fact that the â€œpornâ€? in this movie is bare-bones the minimum of what they could have done. Yes there's nudity in the film but aside from a flat chested Dakota Johnson flash every now and then and someone's a** cheeks popping up on screen, this is some of the most boring â€œpornâ€? that you could watch. The movie tends to cut these scenes long before they have the chance to become interesting and they're not even shot very well. To make matters worse, the pornographic material is the only thing that the movie has going for it. The characters in this movie, they're all bad, all of them. I don't care if you're talking about the potentially wasted guy friend of Anastasia, her roommate, her father, her mother, Christian's mother, his brother, it doesn't matter. They're all bad. The only two characters given any appropriate screen time are Christian and Anastasia themselves and neither one of them are good characters. In fact, they're both poorly written and very, very rage inductively stupid. Anastasia is one of the worst written female characters that I've seen in a film in quite some time. Women always want to talk about how Hollywood doesn't take women seriously and throws them in clichÃ© roles yet, the majority of you hypocrites want to go out and pay to see a dumb bland character like this as a protagonist. To those women out there who paid for this, you're only insulting yourself at this point. Anastasia is stupid, she's dumb, she's bland, she's hardheaded, she's uninteresting, she's not even all that attractive! Dakota Johnson is pretty but she's not a supermodel looking chick and for a rich character like Christian Grey, you would think he would be acting like a stalker/serial killer for someone whom at least looks like a supermodel but no! He goes for the bare-minimum of what he can supposedly get, despite his high profile status which is overemphasized to the point of illogical irrelevance and sheer utter stupidity in this stupid movie. Christian himself to say a few words, is literally as I explained. He personifies the traits of a stalker/serial killer and he can get away with it because he's handsome and he's a billionaire which by the way, and I know this question has been asked with this retarded series but, did a sixteen year old girl write this? An example of this behavior by this Christian character would be a scene near the beginning of the movie just after Anna and Christian meets one another. Anna is in the middle of working at her job and from right around the corner isle, this creepy a**hole just pops up out of nowhere like a damn stalker with the first words out of his mouth being â€œI thought it was youâ€?. Yeah I'm sure you did think it was her. You were probably watching her from the moment she walked out of her home to the moment you decided it was a good idea to wait in a specific isle like the shadow of god damn Michael Myers. That's just a tip of the iceberg of what's wrong with this character. Another scene, the club scene, which is also near the beginning of the movie, Anna gets drunk and Christian calls her scolding her as if he was her father despite the fact that they literally met barely even ten minutes ago in the film. (Phone Ringing) (Christian Grey Calling) Anastasia: â€œI'm sorry I didn't mean,â€? Christian: â€œStay where you are I'm coming to get youâ€? Anastasia: â€œWhat?â€? (Click) ME: â€œThe ****??â€? All this bs and it's not even thirty minutes into the movie! The entire useless two hours of this abysmal calamity has this Anastasia character questioning â€œwell why don't we go on a date?â€? â€œwhy can't I touch you?â€? â€œwhy can't we be like normal people?â€? He explained to you from the beginning what this relationship was going to be!!!! What the ****?!! It takes this girl two hours to grow a brain and say â€œI've had enoughâ€?. You should've been done with him when he showed you his sex dungeon! Any self respecting woman would've dropped this guy at several scenes in this movie but oh no not Anastasia! Because without bs, these lazy Hollywood executives would have no means of selling tickets because the movie would only last five minutes tops. Then the movie takes its bs even further with the Christian Grey character. So when Anastasia isn't getting on your nerves, it's this stupid idiot who sprouts some of the worst dialogue that I've heard in a while. The entire movie, this guy is moping, literally moping and he regurgitates the same thing over and over again. â€œI don't do romanceâ€?, â€œI don't do datingâ€?, â€œI don't do intimacyâ€? Bull****!! All he ever does is romance!! And this movie further misses an opportunity by trying to give this character a back story. Apparently the whole BDSM nonsense comes from him being a submissive to his mother's friend when he was a teenager. The sad part is that the movie could have been about that! The movie could have set up the plot where it was about this guy who was abusing this woman and all the women before her because he was trying to get back at this crazy woman who abused him the same way. But no! Instead what we get is a two hour live action equivalent of the Looney Tunes show, with unrealistic characters bantering the same nonsense back and forth. â€œWhy can't we be normal?â€? â€œI don't do romanceâ€? â€œWhy can't we be normal?â€? â€œI don't do romanceâ€? â€œWhy can't we be normal?â€? â€œI don't do romanceâ€?. Over and over and over and over again like the movie is trying to bash your skull in with poor writing and even worse developed and uninteresting lead characters. And before I close out of this review, I want to mention the contract. Yes, these two idiots in this movie made a contract which discloses exactly what Christian is allowed/not allowed to do to Anastasia when they're engaged in sexual activity but this scene is completely pointless as later in the movie, Christian says it himself. â€œ**** the contractâ€?. Those are his exact words. So why did we insert this scene in this movie again? Oh that's right, it's in the movie to cover up the fact that for two hours, nothing of importance happens in this movie. Fifty Shades of Grey besides Insurgent, another piece of diarrhea vomit that I will also review, is the most recent laziest and cheapest attempt at making money for Hollywood. The movie reeks of tropes that are specifically designed and placed into the film just to attract a dumb audience full of drones that will no doubt buy the Blu-ray on day one which is why this crap is at the number one spot on Amazon.com in the genre of romance which again is funny considering the fact that there is no legit romance in this movie, just BS! Because how can a movie based off a book series that's inspired from something as dull and stupid as the Twilight series possibly be about anything? And that's another thing, even Twilight is better than this! How do you accomplish something like that?!! At least in Twilight you had a decapitation here and there before it returned back to the same some ole repetitive BS. In this nonsense however, there's nothing of interest to look forward to, nothing, not one god damn thing. If this is really what women and I know its not all of you out there but me speaking to the majority. If this is really what women describe as entertainment then it's nothing but dark days ahead for mainstream audiences who like to go to the movies such as myself, even for general audiences. This is why Indies will always be better than what's mainstream in the film industry. There are too many idiots who don't care about the art form of film or even care about movies in general paying to go to the theater and have a â€œgood timeâ€?. These people don't care about pacing or plot or character development. It's the equivalent of everyone who goes to see these fun but regurgitated superhero movies and loud nonsensical IQ insulting CGI fests like the Michael Bay Transformer films. The only difference is that movies like Fifty Shades of Grey, Twilight, and The Host are targeted towards a female audience who think they want to see romance but don't have a clear grasp on what that word actually means. It's a sad day, dark times are ahead for people who actually care about quality entertainment. If anyone has given this more than a one star up on here, you should be ashamed. By the way, can't wait for the even worse sequels to this nonsense, tsk. What's the next one called I wonder. ...Oh Fifty Shades Darker, how original. Yeah if you value common sense and especially if you value decent story telling then do yourself a favor and skip this.
2	So, I don't know what kind of dimwitted mind thought this was a steamy film, or even a romantic film for grown-ups. "Fifty Shades of Grey" is and feels like the byproduct of a corporative contract. If the book it's based on is just laughably pedestrian and dull, the film equivalent nearly rivals it in monotony. There's no emotion, no passion, no life; like Christian Grey, it's all cold, calculated and mechanic. Want to watch a real steamy film about sex for grown-ups? Please go and watch Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' and avoid this infantile, seems-to-be-made-for-promiscuous-teenage-girls drivel at all costs. And, the 'strong sexual content' that the MPAA rating suggests is a joke.
0	Disgraceful, Disgusting, Despicable a negative gimmick that brainwashes young teenage girls into thinking that violent sexual abuse is romance it motivates them to risk try killing themselves with their dickhead boyfriends, an inferior product that brainwashes the youth from coolness and innocent. An inferior woman's wet fantasy of wanting to live an abusively unhealthy sex-life with ruthless millionaires who should be sent to the sanatorium or the sterilization chambers this film is pure garbage. As much as I hate Twilight well this was worse than Twilight Course there are some films like this that I liked that contained the same elements but adding this with nepotistic feminism and chick flick romance and no interesting plot Im sorry it will never impress me, its a movie that leaves also us men completely offended by such biased
1	I have not seen the Film. I am not mature enough yet. But my brother has read the first Chapter of the book. "Poorly Written" his verdict. So, if you want to read the book, Don't bother. Trust me.
0	By far the worst movie I've ever seen. Almost walked out (and I've never done that before). I actually liked the book. Their relationship had humor, intelligence and she had strength that ended up "saving" him. The movie captured none of that. The acting was flat and wooden, the casting was awful. They should have hired Ian Somerhalder. He has the drop dead gorgeous looks of a Christian Grey and he can act. It was so awful they'd have to pay ME to see the other 2 when they come out.
1	Dumb! Firstly, The actors were not right for the role. Secondly, the dialogue could have been better. And thirdly, the entire movie had a choppy feeling with no real chemistry or emotion between the characters. I could go on, but on a short note: 2 thumbs down!! Very disappointed.
9	Sonic Adventure 2 features the world-famous blue hedgehog in a hyper-fast adventure where players can either save the world or conquer it in an action-packed showdown between Hero and Dark characters! You play as Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles and attempt to save the world -- or play as Shadow, Dr. Robotnik, or Rouge and triumph over all who stand in your way. Mistaken for a villain and kidnapped by a military squad, Sonic must escape his captors and discover who is responsible for all his trouble. Jump into the action and check out Sonic's new moves as he grinds rails, swings from poles, and somersaults past the bad guys. Get ready for Sonic action across more than 150 missions spread over 30-plus frenetic, action-packed stages.
2	2 out of 10................................................. For me, the only good part about this movie is Dakota Johnson. I don't want to say anything bad about this movie. End of story.
10	I'm giving this a 10 in hopes to counteract the negative response it has gotten. I respect opinions but in response to comments like, 'is this what women get off to,' I have to object. I didn't 'get off' to this movie; I enjoyed the romance that was unusually portrayed because of Christian's idea of relationships. I didn't read the first book but after watching to movie and seeing the ending, I bought all three books and just finished the second. While the books are not intellectual, it's a good story, not great but not horrible. I loved the movie and I think Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan did very well at bringing these characters to life, could not imagine anyone else playing the part better. I cannot wait until the Fifty Shades Darker.
1	this movie doesn't justify the beautiful detailed book .it really pissed me off watching the movie after reading the book .was really disappointing to know that so many important parts of the book should've been included . the only nice thing in the movie would be the amazing sound tracks
2	No es novedad que un libro tan viral, con tantas ventas, al final del dÃ­a realicen una pelicula sobre esta. Quiero decir que no leÃ­ el libro (ni lo leerÃ©) pero en cuestiÃ³n de adaptaciÃ³n y censura, supongo que tuvieron que cortar demasiadas escenas de sexo (algunas sumamente estÃºpidas) para que esta pelicula lograra por lo menos una clasificaciÃ³n "R" (o C en MÃ©xico) pero en fin, recuerdo que me sentÃ© frente a la computadora y me dije: "verÃ© esta pelicula sin la necesidad de buscarle contras o con la intenciÃ³n de criticarla" pero esto no duro ni 10 minutos, la pelicula es un error total, en primer lugar, no me cabe en la cabeza la idea de que esta pelicula es romance y amor (el cual no lo es) pues yo solo veo una atmÃ³sfera tÃ©trica, oscura, estÃºpida, repleta de Sadomasoquismo o masoquismo. Â¿Desde cuando las mujeres ven a un hombre enfermo mental atractivo? no lo entiendo, Â¿sera porque es millonario? Â¿tiene autos de lujo? no tengo idea. Fifty Shades of Grey cuenta la historia de Anastasia, una estudiante virgen tÃ­mida que va a entrevistar a Christian Grey para un trabajo de su compaÃ±era de cuarto, la interacciÃ³n de Jamie Dornan con Dakota Johnson es plana, no se sienten reales, Anastasia siempre tiene la misma cara: "orgasmo" "tristeza" "orgasmo" "enojo" "orgasmo". La relaciÃ³n de estos dos es tonta, aburrida y poco interesante, ambos personajes no aportan nada de carisma, se vuelven tediosos y odiosos, por poner un ejemplo: Christian Grey: "te regale un auto, una computadora, libros y todo lo que tu desees Â¿seras mi sumisa? Anastasia: No, no quiero volver a verte (pasan 2 minutos) Te amo. Por el amor de Dios, esta pelicula es basura! Con lo que respecta a las escenas de sexo, prometen mas de lo que son, asÃ­ que no vayas con la idea de que veras escenas sexuales sumamente explicitas y polÃ©micas. Sam Taylor-Johnson hace lo que puede en esta pelicula, no es culpa de ella que la pelicula no funcionara, de hecho se ve que puso todo su esfuerzo para que al menos fuera pasable, la culpa la tiene la historia (y por supuesto la escritora E.L James) una historia aburrida, nada interesante, mediocre y con poca originalidad (Â¿olvide mencionar que esto es "CrepÃºsculo" con sexo?) Lo unico perdonable de aquÃ­ es el Soundtrack (por parte de Danny Elfman) no es que sea una obra maestra, pero es lo unico decente que tiene esta pelicula (Â¿esto se le puede llamar pelicula? este termino no entra aquÃ­...)
5	A movie that thrives mostly on Dakota Johnson's performance as the central character "Anastassia". I enjoyed the chemistry between her and the stone-cold Christian Grey, played by Jamie Dornan, and it was really the only reason I could sit through 2+ hrs. of this adult version of Twilight. While the movie isn't that good at all, the relationship assessments were intriguing. The realization that relationships require trust to be built and maintained, and that anyone can have a dark sexual fantasy or skeleton in their closet that is unknown to the world is always fascinating and very real. Learning to release the shame and risk being vulnerable to another person scares the crap out of so many people in the world, but properly-placed trust offers incredible rewards, and I think that Christian Grey is on his way to learning that. The problem I have with that is there's two more books to address that, and I'm curious how anyone can muster up enough on-screen time to make any audience feel like they should show up. The first movie coasted on anticipation and controversy. A second and third film wouldn't benefit from that luxury. Perhaps Focus Features and the screen-adaptation can work to remedy any literary faults and find ways to charge the 50 Shades story with more interest, instead of relying solely on the sexual fantasies of women to find success.
3	Kinky not really Fifty Shades of Grey falls flat. The problem is that the film is pretty boring and also has a poor script. You can definitely see the Twilight fan fiction though this film at least looks good. D
1	Not much to say about this movie, all hype no substance. The movie dragged on, had a crappy ending and the scenes inbetween were forgettable, like watching the same scenes over and over again. Would suggest you get the book, i'm sure it will be more visually entertaining.
3	Not the blockbluster / shocking movie everyone was assuming it would be, but still a reasonable one. Pity that the offical sound track didn't included Britney Spears - Hit me baby one more time :)
5	What a **** is this?! **** at all topics! Who likes that? Only silly people. Guess, have i watched this? No! Haven't even thought about this. But have seen good review on YouTube.
7	great film! not sure I understand the hype? good storyline and screen play, but nothing extra special? ben Affleck is obviously talented as a director, writer and actor. but for me it falls short of any other critically acclaimed film this year? Alan Arkin is superb and partnered with John Goodman they make a humours, realistic depiction of their characters. A great film, and a must see if you like a tense drama... but isn't the best film of the year? its barely memorable!
7	Argo is a spectacular movie full of tension, drama and tricks. First, we notice that the story is very original, not only because of the invasion to the US embassy in Teheran, from where six people escaped, but also because of the idea that the CIA has to take them out of Iran, make a fake movie so this people act like the film crew. Second, everything becomes more interesting when we see that the film is based on true events. Third, is amazing the levels of tension that reach this picture, every detail fits perfectly in the puzzle that created Ben Affleck to reveal the outcome. Fourth, there are some great scenes that show the contemporary modus operandi and mentality of the American people; like at the invasion of the embassy, the workers must destroy all the confidential documents instead of run away; another one is in the first reunion of the CIA when is noticeable that this men do not know or care of knowing about other cultures than their own; and the last one is when then protagonist goes to Hollywood and discovers that no one actually works there. Fifth, its surprising the idea of the story inside a story, because the ending of the plot in the fake film is the same that the one in the real picture. Finally this is one of those pictures were the whole cast perform good, highlighting Tony Mendez, the six that escaped and the maid of the ambassador. With an excellent direction this is definitely an outstanding film. Argo **** yourself.
7	It's an interesting movie and well directed. It gives you some insight as to what happened. Though I would have liked some scenes on the other embassy employees that were held hostage. The best part for me was seeing the old Swissair 747 take off.... (But that's just because I'm Swiss)........... Btw, that 747 was named Argovia (after the Kanton/State Aargau) Argo is the short version.
10	Excellent, understated film. Not that realistic, and as over-simplified as any true story has to be, but the detail and drama are really well done, and the acting is perfectly understated (apart from Arkin, who is just good fun). I don't follow the criticism that the film is pro-US propaganda. It unflinchingly (and accurately) lays the balme for many of Iran's woes at US foreign policy's door, where they belong. And then tells a cracking, terrific story.
6	The movie had excellent visuals and period feel. The acting was good too. I also liked the subject matter. But the pace was slow, so the movie became a drag at times. Something was off the entire time. I cannot bring myself to watch it again. There are other movies with serious tone and longer running time like The Pianist and Shawshank Redemption that manage to pull it off and are highly entertaining. Argo definitely doesn't deserve the highest prize at the Oscars.
0	A one-sided self-satisfying nationalist and political propaganda film with no real suspense and substance. With highly-implausible inventions to reality that make it look stupid to the audience with some common sense and minimum level knowledge of the situation. The silly car chase on the airport runway or the lack of explanation for why the airliner is not turned back to the airport by the control tower, or the American women wandering provocatively (taking photos) among the Muslim Persians with no head-covering (the stupidest thing of all), etc.
0	After all the talk, I thought well maybe Ben Affleck did something good after all, but I was sceptical. I was right. This movie is just one big orgy of tough man tough talk, which really gets annoying after 20 minutes or so. There is completely no character development in any of the hostages. I had a hard time not falling asleep. What an incredible bore.
8	Argo is a great story that sells itself on the fact that it is an insane, but true story. It's a good movie, but it really isn't great in any capacity. The performances were on, but afflec's distance felt forced. The story was interesting, but very predictable, and very Hollywood (I guess that might be part of the point, so we'll let that pass). There wasn't anything bad in Argo, in fact, you could say it was flawless. However, I don't feel it did justice to the historical situation, and that something was indeed missing. In a year that didn't include Zero Dark Thirty, I might not be looking for that extra something, but I digress.
8	Patient script that at times seems to move a little bit too slow. The film feels very authentic. Affleck does a nice job in directing and acting in this flick. The ending left a little to be desired. Overall, solid film.
4	I thought this was a bit of a let down. Loved the Town but Argo wasn't gritty enough for me. Some Iranian security guards with some intelligence would have been nice. The film also plays up the Ã§oolness' of making a fake movie, which detracts from the seriousness of the subject matter for me. Funky music as they arrive on their fake set, hmm. And 'Argo f!@k yourself' gets very annoying. Big let down. And we all know how it's going to end. Amazing thing they did though.
10	Unbelievably great movie! I had some trepidation if Affleck could bring this very serious story to the screen with as much emotion and respect required for this story. I hoped he could bring out the feelings of the true life players in this true story. Well, Ben brought his A game and then some. I'm writing this the day before Oscar night and wonder how this didn't get him a best actor nomination. I think he was tremendous in acting directing! I was on the edge of my seat through the whole movie; though I knew the outcome. I believe this is exceptional movie that stays true to the story. I believe Victor Gather should have gotten the nomination for supporting role rather than Alan Arkin; though his performance is good. First movie I've ever given 10 stars on.
5	Ben's Argo and Lance's Medals What do these have in common? Both generated great gobs of money, both represent a dramatic distortion of the truth, both take another significant chunk out of American credibility. It is bad enough that a majority of America receives its education (17th or lower in world ranking) from movies, in Argo's case "based on a declassified true story". When Ben claimed, in a recent interview, that the reason the Canadians integral role (90% Canada/ 10% USA according to president Jimmy Carter and those actually involved) in freeing the hostages was not represented truthfully, he brushed it off quickly by commenting that "there was not enough time to fit it all in". In other words, for Ben, making the Americans "centre of the universe" even under the guise of docudrama, trumps truth. The reality is that the small role the CIA did actually play, had the real potential of getting the hostages killed on their way out of Iran. Historically (pun intended) the CIA espionage folk put a wrong date on the passport stamp which if not detected, and altered (again by a Canadian) would have meant instant detection, and potentially certain death on their way out of the airport not to mention what would have happened to the Canadian embassy personnel. Dramatic license must be extended to any historical account for time constraints or the inevitable lapse in research, however, when the focus is to distort and or pervert the truth, everyone involved suffers. Ben in recent award shows, still attempts to use his youthful ignorance and surprised-face to pass off this travesty of history. I don't buy that, or the movie nor should anyone interested in the truth. Historical accuracy can be every bit as dramatic and entertaining as BS with the added bonus of attracting a wider audience and staying on the charts for many more years. No doubt, all those, who have or will receive monetary gain from this schlock will rally to its defense, somehow. There is no defense, however, for the damage inflicted on the historical record, those who buy into that distortion, or the Canadians, and the lives of six US hostages whose lives depended on real intervention by real people.

8	Generally, there are three themes that tend to be favored by award community and film critics, the winning themes are about humanity (â€œSchindlerâ€™s Listâ€? {1993}, â€œThe Shawshank Redemption {1994}, â€œSlumdog Millionaireâ€? {2008}, etc.), patriotism (â€œSaving Private Ryanâ€? {1998}, â€œBlack Hawk Downâ€? {2001}, â€œLincolnâ€? {2012}, etc.) and the world of cinema itself (â€œCinema Paradisoâ€? {1998}, â€œHugoâ€? {2011}, â€œThe Artistâ€? {2011}, etc.). Well, thiz movie has all three of them. Producer, Director and Actor Ben Affleck is smart enough to realize it and takes advantage of that. Ben Affleck is Tony Mendez, a CIA agent who is responsible for covert operation to extract six American embassy employees out of the rage of Iran revolutionary by pretending to be Canadian film crew. It seems that Ben Affleck has done a tremendous job as the Director. He starts with an effective prologue to provide sufficient information and every time the scene heats up, particularly when the scene of American embassy is invaded, he cleverly adds relaxing piano instrumental music to cool things down and doesnâ€™t try to provoke audience into infuriated reactions. Thiz is his third feature films behind the camera after â€œGone Baby Goneâ€? (2007) and â€œThe Townâ€? (2010). For the acting, Ben Afflecks looks cool, calm and confident. John Goodman, Bryan Cranston and Victor Garber give brief but consistent performances and the last but definitely not least, Alan Arkin creates a powerful and believable emotion as fearless Hollywood Producer. I also have to put some credit to the Production Designer Sharon Seymour who successfully makes everything look like 1980s such as costume, hairstyle, glasses, car, furniture, television, telephone, everything! How they put attention to detail is undoubtedly amazing. Personally, for me, the power of thiz movie is in the last half hour. Thiz is a good example of what you can get when great script and great editing are perfectly combined. My heart nearly stopped while watching thiz final scene which takes place in Iran airport. They use almost all aspects to create tensions from ticket, telephone, soldier, bus, you name it and they have done it. When itâ€™s over, there will be some satisfying and gratifying feelings. In the closing scene, when the camera pans over the toys of Star Wars, Planet of the Apes and other sci-fi movies one by one. It simply wants to remind us that they are not only inspirational icons in our pop culture, but also they have ever saved lives. Great movie, great story, great moviemaker!

9	True story excellent direction and storyline absolute deserve the best film of 2012! Exciting dark story A good movie without past history story, so it bring a original thinking on this movie.
6	This movie is obviously overrated and mediocre. Total lack of 70's atmosphere, the Hollywood side story is very weak and unconvincing, most performances give you the feeling of watching a History Channel documenrary. The film is boring and the adrenaline in the airport scene is boosted with cheap tricks rather than fine and skillfull movie direction: the Iranians realize the truth at the exact moment the Americans flee the country. How convenient is that.... Best motion picture of the year award? seriously??? LMAO....
0	"the town" was a million times better than this movie. this is the most overrated underwhelming movie i think i have ever seen. had it been nominated last year for best picture it wouldn't have had a chance. the academy needs to recognize more genres for best picture. "this is 40" isn't an instant classic, but there's more feeling put into that comedy than this drama. this belonged on lifetime, not on the big screen. i want to tell anyone who voted for this movie "argo f*** yourself."
5	Apparently film critic Leonard Maltin liked Argo and is quoted as saying, â€œDon't get your history from the movies.â€? Maybe it would be better to say, â€œDon't put history in your movies if you don't get it.â€? Argo was a good film but it wasn't about what it claimed to be about. If you're going to fiddle with very minor historical moments, maybe no one will notice or care, but this was a major event in recent American history. A short summary of what never happened--there was no trip to the Bazaar, which would have been too dangerous; the six were divided up at the homes of two Canadian officials, not one, and they all liked the idea of the movie production team as their cover; the airport screening went off without a hitch--no one confronted them and no squad cars chased the plane down--the only tension was the announcement that there would be a 1-hour delay because of mechanical problems. However, after the plane cleared Iranian air space, everybody cheered. They got that part right. Some feel that Iranians have a right to object to the stereotypical portrayal of their citizens, and Canada feels that the CIA is being made to look like the heroes, when the Canadians did most of the work, which included three months of preparation for the final coup. A scene at the end of the film gives the erroneous impression that Canada had to be given the credit because no one was allowed to know that the CIA was involved, in which case, it sounded almost like Canada was taking the heat for the CIA rather than being lauded for heroism. Ben Affleck is a good director and a good actor, but his fantasy version of the story should have been filmed as fiction and not fact. Argo worked well when it showed insiders being caustically critical of how a Hollywood production is run behind the scenes. (That would make a good movie by itself.) The film might have been a good thriller, but when you go into it knowing that the most exciting part, the airport clearance and chase at the end, never happened, it's not that thrilling. It's boring. In any case, the film has nothing to do with the American government's view of the episode; it's just trying to be pure Hollywood entertainment, using all the old tricks that all directors and screenwriters use to lure people into the theaters so that the studios can make money. And given how many bad films are being released lately, a film that shows directorial skill and tells a good story ends up being exaggerated to the point where it wins Best Picture. Argo was not the best picture, but the pickings were slim. They couldn't even come up with ten selections at the Oscars--they had nine, and one movie, Amour, was listed twice under Best Picture and Best Foreign Picture. In the end, no one should be insulted by Argo--it's not worth it.
6	If you strip away the historical and political relevance of Argo and the knowledge that the events in the movie are based on reality, you are left with an average thriller. The characters in this movie are shells of characters; I could describe each of them in a single sentence. The plot of Argo eventually turns into the repetition of an age old formula: build suspense, make it look like the bad thing is going to happen, make the good thing happen at the last second. Rinse and repeat. It's boring and predictable and repetitive and entirely unoriginal. I think it's worth watching, but I doubt I'll ever watch it again.
4	puh-leez, this movie was not that good. won the oscars because the industry is a scene that celebrates itself. the movie was average and uncompelling. ben afleck is about as talented an actor as keanu reeves.
10	Argo is a success. This film is one of the ones that i will remember my whole life. The last 30 mins are absolutely heart-pounding and i just love how ben affleck tells the story of Tony Mendez through his direction and acting. Argo is one of the best.
8	Argo was a very good film but Picture of the Year it was not. Sorry Academy but you got it wrong once again. Don't mistake this for bashing. Like I said, Argo was a very good film. Ben Affleck has proven once again that he's not only a fantastic and underrated actor but that he's becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood. Argo had great pacing for the type of movie it is, the plot developed perfectly, the characters all felt real and authentic, etc. The only negative I would really have is that some of the suspense felt cheap and forced. Sure, they truly did escape Iran. That part is a true story. However, how close they were to getting caught is not necessarily known. So the fact that the final 30 minutes of the movie was close call after close call and that these scrapes didn't develop authentically but felt manufactured was not ideal. Nonetheless, I'd say this is a really good movie that, while it's a little overrated and overhyped (it won Picture of the Year when I'm not even sure it's the best true story CIA film of the year that would probably be Zero Dark Thirty), most people would still enjoy. "Argo f*** yourself!"
7	Allâ€™inizio della crisi degli ostaggi in Iran, un piccolo gruppo fuoriuscito dallâ€™ambasciata degli Stati Uniti durante lâ€™assalto alla stessa finisce per ritrovarsi in una posizione piÃ¹ pericolosa rispetto ai diplomatici rimasti prigionieri: riparati in casa dellâ€™ambasciatore canadese, non hanno addosso gli occhi del mondo e ogni giorno che passa il rischio di venir scoperti e processati aumenta. Per portarli a casa, la Cia si inventa un falso film di fantascienza, â€˜Argoâ€™, da girarsi in esotiche locations persiane: sul filo del rasoio, lâ€™operazione riesce, ma lâ€™agente Mendez che il tutto ha apparecchiato e portato a termine non puÃ² ricevere i pubblici elogi fino a quando Clinton, ventâ€™anni dopo, non toglie il segreto sulla missione. Per raccontarne la storia, lâ€™esordiente Affleck gira un film dâ€™azione senza pecche, basato su di una sceneggiatura di Chris Terrio che segue la traccia dei fatti drammatizzandone alcune parti (una questione che appare secondaria, non trattandosi di un documentario). Nella prima ora, la tensione si stempera grazie ai tocchi di commedia che si possono trovare nei dialoghi serrati allâ€™interno dellâ€™Agenzia e durante la parentesi holliwoodiana (alcune battute sono un poâ€™ telefonate ma pazienzaâ€¦), poi il ritmo si fa sempre piÃ¹ serrato, fra montaggio incrociato con qualche discrepanza sui fusi orari e possibili pericoli evitati per un soffio che lasciano con il fiato sospeso. Lâ€™occhio del regista restituisce in modo efficace un mondo del tutto analogico, fatto di telescriventi e grossi nodi alla cravatta, raggiungendo i risultati migliori negli interni ambientati a Langley e inquadrati come negli anni Settanta. Alla riuscita collabora un cast esperto e ben assortito, in cui oltre allâ€™Affleck attore, con barba e capello lungo molto Seventies spiccano Cranston (il capo duro ma sensibile) e, soprattutto, la coppia Arkin/Goodman che, a Los Angeles, fornisce la base logistica al falso film strappando anche qualche sorriso: in confronto, risultano meno definiti i sei in fuga, con il solo Scoot McNairy che ha la possibilitÃ  di rendere un poâ€™ meno bidimensionale il suo personaggio, il piÃ¹ dubbioso nei confronti del piano di Mendez. Detto tutto questo, e confermato che le due ore scorrono veloci e coinvolgenti, lascia perplessi che â€˜Argoâ€™ sia stato preferito a â€˜Lincolnâ€™ nella corsa agli Oscar e lâ€™unico motivo che pare plausibile lâ€™eccesso patriottico. Non che il film di Spielberg manchi di retorica a stelle e strisce, ma vuoi mettere un film ambientato un secolo e mezzo fa che parla di una spaccatura interna non del tutto superata neppure oggi con uno costruito attorno a un momento storico che tantissimi di noi hanno vissuto e ha il pregio di poter nettamente separare i buoni dai cattivi? Se non fosse per il prologo in cui si accenna alla responsabilitÃ  anglo-americana nella caduta di Mossadeq che spianÃ² la strada al feroce regime di Reza Pahlavi la Cia ne esce candida come un giglio (e alla fine rinuncia anche ad appuntarsi la medaglia al merito) mentre gli iraniani sono rappresentati, a parte la barba, alla stregua degli indiani dei film di una volta violenti, urlanti e pure un poâ€™ tonti: se un dato di fatto che la Rivoluzione Islamica non sia stata un pranzo di gala, la banalizzazione risulta comunque fastidiosa.
8	Not knowing what the ending will be like, kept me on the edge of my seat! Yes, the real story wasnt real to the true story. But the movie did pull off one thing, and thats tension!
9	A wonderful film with lovely attention to detail. From the old school Warner logo to the side-by-side comparison shots at the end, Argo has clearly had a lot of work put into, what is, a fairly simple plot. It is engrossing throughout as the situation worsens and the bizarre rescue plot looks doomed to failure. A somewhat sedate pace is amped up towards the last half hour. Details are probably fudged for dramatic tension but the nice thing is that no one member of the cast goes for the obvious grandstanding. Even Affleck resists at points where a more overblown performance would have taken away from the film. The film looks great, with a great late 70's cinema feel. The soundtrack has some nice tunes in there as well to carry the mode. Pity John Goodman doesnt get to shine as much as I'd like but thats a minor quibble. Is it worth the oscar? How should I know, but it is worth the two hours of your time.
9	While a sizeable proportion of America got caught up with whether or not Tony Mendez should be considered hispanic or not, the rest of us experienced one of Ben Affleck's better performances in a movie that essentially cements his reputation as a 5-star director. Ben Affleck is the new Oliver Stone. No, let me rephrase that Oliver Stone wishes he was Ben Affleck...
9	Wow who could believe that Ben Affleck would become this good of a director. Argo is his best work to date and lined with a great cast including Affleck himself, this film has some very suspenseful moments.
9	This is not my favorite film of the year but it is the most well made film of the year on an all around score. It lacks my emotional captivation however it brings all the well moving parts of a hot evenly paced thriller (of sorts). It brings a fantastic script alive and I may forgive Affleck for faults in his previous career stumbles.
2	This is a boring story. A CIA agent flies a commercial airliner into Tehran, and flies out two days later with six endangered Americans. There is no firefight, no border crossing, not even a romantic subplot. The entire appeal of this movie is that it is historical "based on true events" says the promo but it turns out the movie has little to do with what actually happened in 1980. The CIA played a small part in the rescue, the Canadians did all the work, and most of the scenes are complete bunk. Given the lack of historical content, Ben Affleck could have thrown in a car chase or two, a "traitor within" subplot, or maybe had the 747 pursued by Iranian fighter jets and chased off by a Sopwith camel. Better yet, have the aliens from Argo intervene on behalf of the good guys (assuming that is us). It's all crap history anyway.
10	lo deja a uno sin aliento ,argo es una obra maestra bien pensada y ejecutada pero lo que mas marca a argo con una pelÃ­cula excepcional es su ultimo acto donde los americanos se suben al aviÃ³n ira-ni
8	Disregarding some factual controversy and looking at it solely as a film, Argo is quite well made. The performances are great and the film does a good job of keeping things moving. However, when compared to some other pictures from this year I don't know that I'd agree that its "Best Picture" good.
7	Argo doesn't quite succeed entirely. Despite excelling in its screenplay, structure, pacing and especially its cinematography; Argo delivers not-so stunning acting performances (apart from Alan Arkin- who steals the show) and its character construction is rather unsatisfying- Tony Mendez never really strays beyond the cliche of a workaholic divorcee. Overall, its a nice little piece of American propaganda, as well as being a competent thriller, but it doesn't wholly fulfil its promise.
9	Impresionante, la puesta en escena, la interpretaciÃ³n, y lo crehÃ­ble de la historia aunque parezca increhÃ­ble. Ben Affleck extraordinario, convirtiendo al actor en un buenÃ­simo director.
6	argo is an overall good film. I feel that a few scenes fell flat and many supporting characters were unnecessary because they had such small roles, but the overall film has plenty of nail-biting moments and phenomonal acting.
7	Not bad. No way. It's okay. It's well above average. But it isn't an appropriate Best Film of the the Year. Have fun, watch it--then go see a real stand out: Zero Dark 30.
10	Argo is magnificently brilliant in every way. It's perfect in terms of espeonauge and story telling (even though it's based on a true story). Not only was there great acting, but director, Ben Affleck, reels in some great acting as well. But overall, Affleck has given us an incredible experience of how far one man will go to save the lives of others.
10	Argo is a true thriller, bringing together suspense as well as an edge-of-your-seat experience. Were the people able to get out alright? I was granted a solid and well developed answer to this question. Unbelievable.
8	IF this movie is an 8 and frankly I gave it an 8 mainly because it won the Oscar for best film it is certainly a weak 8. While an interesting film, there is little special going on here. This really makes one wonder about the entire awards process. An entertaining two hours, but nothing that will leave you feeling you have seen something extraordinary.
7	If I were to criticize the film Iâ€™d have to say is that it was overrated. It was good but it was not that good. I quite honestly was not invested the whole time only at certain parts. Maybe this is not my kind of film. Maybe Iâ€™m just not used to the style. I donâ€™t know for whatever reason the movie did not suck me in the way it did lots of critics. Frequently in the film I was bored. I donâ€™t know if the characters and story were not interesting, if it was the amount of dialogue; but for whatever reason I just thought it was good. Maybe if the film took more liberties from the actual event by creating false events to create more tension and excitement, the actors gave stronger performances, and the script a little tighter I would have really enjoyed this film; but as it is the film is just good. Way too overrated by critics if you ask me.
6	Argo has been praised by both critics and audience alike. Bit surprisingly, as despite being better than average political thriller it is difficult to believe it would be looked back as Oscar-winning classic. It has inaccuracies and dramatizations which have too much of a scripted feel, given the story is based on real events.
10	I was completely surprised by this movie. I thought it was going to be dull, but every line spoken is either interesting or funny. Very suspenseful. Must watch!
3	A very mediocre piece of U.S patriotic drama. That the film took out the Oscar for Best Picture is a sad reflection on the dim witted fervour of The Academy. Despite an honest opening sequence that attempts to give some sketch of the destructive involvement of the CIA in Iran, the film plunges straight into an overt juxtaposition of idyllic American civilisation and the barbarism of the middle east that is rife and disturbing. The vilification of the Iranian people and the shallow representation of the context of the tragic circumstances destroys the integrity of the film on all levels. There are some acute performances in small places, but with Affleck on screen most of the time, everything is rendered pretty flat and monochrome. Shocker.
9	Despite some historical inaccuracies and having a pro-American approach, this is a fast paced political thriller which also has some moments of comedy (from Alan Arkin in one of his best roles) under the direction of star Ben Affleck who has now become something of a pro at making edge-of-your-seat movies. One of the best of 2012.
8	I went into watching Argo with an open mind as I was unfamiliar with the subject matter. I decided to watch it due to its high rating. All I can say is that I'm glad I gave it a try. With Argo you get an intelligent thriller packed with plenty of suspense and tension (particularly the last 30 minutes). All the main cast put on solid performances Affleck was good, but I felt John Goodman was excellent in the limited screen time that he had). The plot is good and it unfolds at an even pace, I didn't feel that there were any scenes that were dragged out for too long. My only gripe was the airport chase scene towards the end which I felt was totally unrealistic. Having said that, I would say Argo is still highly recommended viewing. Enjoy!
8	This year's top films: Zero Dark Thirty, Lincoln, Argo. Without comparison, Argo is a fine film. Tension is high, story is strong, and acting all around is good. With comparison however, I'm afraid it just doesn't measure up with Lincoln or Zero Dark Thirty. I'm afraid Argo got the "pity vote" this year......but I suppose it still pays the bills, right Ben? A win is a win.
8	More should have happened in this movie. It doesn't seem that way at first glance, but....don't you feel like they should have been questioned more and had more intense moments? In the second half of the movie I was prepared to handle a bunch of vigorous interrigations, but it just didn't happen. One single questioning period at the end is all that really stuck out. Anyways besides that one complaint it was a good show throughout.
8	Argo is tense and exciting with well written characters. The recognizable names help push it to greater heights. I give this film 83%.
10	THE BEST movie since Gladiator (2000)!!! All those tension, all those mystery, with some good humor... highly recommended!!!
9	Beautifully made with all everything from the costumes to the technology accurate to a tee. I loved the way the film was intercut with archive news footage of the time; this really gave the audience a sense of the world at that juncture. All the performances were excellent with Ben Affleck taking centre stage, but I really enjoyed seeing Alan Arkin as a Hollywood producer; he stole it for me! There was real tension towards the end of the film; it slowly builds for quite a long time and I found that quite masterful. Itâ€™s something that has been missing from many Hollywood films for a long time now but Affleck seems to have rediscovered the art. Because itâ€˜s a film based in real events, thereâ€™s little time for character development and I think it suffers slightly because of it. Other than that, it has some interesting songs on the soundtrack and itâ€™s well worth a look! SteelMonsterâ€™s verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 8.6/10
10	Argo is absolutely incredible. I have never had encountered so much suspense in a single movie. The plot was splendid, the acting was amazing, and the plan of Tony Mendez was crazy. I felt that this movie was very serious, but had sets of comic relief, with Lester and John Chambers. Overall, this movie has soared into being one of my favorite movies and I suggest everyone should check it out.
9	It felt like the movie started out a little slow. But, that feeling went away pretty quickly. Argo is easily one of the best movies of 2012. Ben Affleck, John Goodman, Bryan Cranston and the rest of the crew deliver an Oscar-worthy performance.
6	The movie is very overrated, and I believe because Ben Affleck did a multitasking job, which I respect, but not enough to swipe nearly every Best Film category. The film lacked the opportunity given by having one of the greatest casts of 2012 and Ben Affleck seemed to shine himself, which wouldn't have been a major issue if he actually brought great emotion to his role, which was needed but never really delivered. Not considering the multiple awards, I did enjoy the film and it's colorful characters aside from Ben Affleck's.
9	Truth by chance. That is what Argo is. What Ben Affleck did is he took a really really awkward 'true' story and made a goddamn movie with it. So, it's rather funny how more serious things are portrayed in this film with true transparency and real ease. What more to say? You have to spend 120 minutes of your life being spellbound or damned by watching this. And only then you'll probably can decide whether to kiss me or to shoot me. Well, I might answer, 'Argo, damn yourself!' (They don't wanna let me write what I actually want to.)
10	A shocking movie full good quality Actors and Actions Magnificent like Goodman and Alan Arkin Jhon without removing the Ben Affleck and Bryan Cranston keeps you in the seat expectant that happen in the movie is full of stress and Action
10	Argo makes all the right moves and deviates greatly from what is expected from such a serious situation as the the Iranian hostage crisis. Ben Affleck continues his commanding streak as director and lead actor, he takes on a film based on a true story, and what a story it is. Affleck plays Tony Mendez, a CIA operative whose speciality is exfiltration, and when he is brought in to the fold after six embassy workers in Iran escape, he must devise a plan to safely rescue them from Iranian rule. This plan has of course went down in history, whether for its riskiness, stupidity or genius is anyone's guess. Mendez himself carries out the task, an elaborate plan is set in motion where he, and the six people he plans to rescue, are a film crew who are location scouting in Iran, they all have fake identities and Argo proves that everything is about detail, a fake script, storyboard, marketing tools and even press involvement for a film that will never actually exist, simply for the fact that getting in is not the problem, but getting out is a whole different story. There are plenty of colourful characters that light up this wonderful thriller, Alan Arkin, John Goodman and Bryan Cranston join Affleck in creating a very nostalgic and peak into the world of 1970s operations. Arkins portrayal of Lester Siegel is brilliant and one of the highlights of the film, while Affleck perfectly captures the dad in Mendez, who just wants to be with his family. Of course the the real winning formula of the film is the ludicrous idea of the fake movie to get in and out of Iran, and Argo (which is also what the fake film is called) manages to give a realistic and nerve-wracking account of just how difficult and frightening it was to be an American with the the boundaries of Iran, something we are shown as the credits role, when various screens from the film are put against the real images taken all those years ago. Diretor Affleck continues to surpass all expectations and is truly solidifying himself as one of the most talented and sought after directors in our generation, is ability to to take various pivotal moments within a character and create a rousing and entertaining story are becoming unmatched, he has taken a very serious crisis and managed to create a often humorous yet thrilling affair, with a final act that will definitely leave you at the edge of your seat, time is indeed of the essence. If any film deserved Oscar recognition, it was Argo, its taste for nostalgia while taking on a subject that only became declassified almost 20 years after the crisis. It is a true blend of genres that has created a winning film through and through.
8	Compared to the book basis is laughable, but with cinematographic look is very interesting, because its narrative line is modern and funny, but knows how to be serious and rough, the dialogues are otimos especially when the topic is holiwood, the second best thing is the performance of Alan Arkin, who gives a satirical tone in the dialogues, another very interesting thing is the accuracy of the portrayal of facts acontecidos.Esse film proves that Ben Afleck can indeed perform well and drive good shape.
7	as most people i was over-excited to watch argo because my all time favorite movies are the ones based on true stories the movie have a good reputation an Oscar for best picture and add-in the fact that i love the movies directed by ben affleck so was the excitement worth it unfortunately no the movie is good not great and it have so many elements missing first of all it is one of the best Rescues in U.S history that we know of so it have to be intense but the fact that it's not intense only in a few scenes far away from eachother with some cold acting by ben affleck and not even a single intense acting scene and the fact that there isn't a soundtrack until the second half of the movie makes you disconnect from the story every 10 minutes i mean it's pretty obvious giving that ben affleck didn't recieve an Oscar for best directing because of these missing elements that made the movie a little bit disappointing but i give a pledge to the movie for showing real events with characters as exact as the real people and shine a light on those people because of what they have gone through.
9	Argo is an intense thriller with almost no shots fired or over-the-top action. And the fact that it all actually happend makes it even more intense. The humor is great, the cast is brilliant, the shots look good, it all makes this movie so enjoyeble to watch. I highly recommend Argo, one of the best films of 2012!
7	In the end, this was kind of underwhelming. The performances are fine (although Affleck doesn't do much aside from looking glum), the recreation of the events using real footage is excellently done, and the story is quite compelling, but the problem is with the script. Dialogue tends toward cliche at times and the moments of tension feel overly manufactured. The film is strongest in its opening sequence as the hostage crisis unfolds, and in the scenes shared with John Goodman and Alan Arkin who have a lot of fun with their roles. The ending lays on the 'America Always Triumphs' adage pretty thick; it's easy to see how it won Best Film at the Oscars. Solid, if uninspiring.
10	"No question and hands down one of the best films of this year. Argo is an award contender that's for sure. With Affleck's fantastic direction and an amazing in depth story. Argo is a movie were going to be talking about for years and years to come." A+
6	Argo manages to make an American movie without losing the essence of its context or the main depiction of the history. It's simple, easy to follow and understand, requires no previous knowledge or anything. But perhaps this is the problem; whilst it's straightforward it lacks in depth, and the two hour run-time is slightly too long given how predictable it is and how little goes on in it. There's almost no suspense until the last half an hour, and the bits before are practically oversized fillers. Still a good film but either needs to be more concise or have more content or action for it to be a great one.
10	A beautiful film that was nailed to the people, because this movie was made about my country. I had got a movie. Oscar was really the writing life. Mr. Affleck hurt. Blowing hot
10	Amazing, well acted, well directed, gorgeous, breathtaking, suspenseful, amazing, well shot, wonderfully executed, and the list goes on and on. Argo, is a truly unique story and what makes it more unique is that all the events in the film actually happened. Argo is gold! A cinematic experience that will keep you at the edge of your seat the entire time. Its good old fashioned suspenseful excitement that is complete eye candy. I guarantee that ANYONE who watches this movie will enjoy it in any way, shape or form. Go watch Argo!
10	A triumphant piece of cinema. Argo consists of tension, sincerity, mystery, artistic responsibility, entertainment value, technical expertise, cinematography that seems like eye candy to the viewers and starling performances delivered by a cast of breakthrough actors. After years of experience in the movie world, I think Affleck has finally given us his masterpiece. This is a near flawless film given to us with an old-school espionage thrill ride with a truly flawless script along with dialogue that offers us with many memorable quotes and sarcastic and witty comedic relief. Every actor on screen does his or her job but there were three supporting actors that stole the every scene they were in: Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman. A film worth remembering.
7	I liked Argo. In fact I even bought it on DVD. It's a very well made movie and it's entertaining. Afleck directs it with attention to detail and the story is rendered with a well written screenplay. The acting is solid from all of the cast and there are some tense and exciting moments. It also has a very authentic 70's feel, even utilizing vintage styled cinematography at times. All of that being said, I still found it to be very overrated. Yes there are some tense moments, but I wished there were even more, and the ones in the film, except for the beginning, could have been even tenser, seeing what Afleck did with The Town. The car chase at the end felt fake for some reason and some other scenes felt kinda flat too. Yes it's overall a good movie and another success for Afleck, but I don't think it deserved best picture. I think it should have went to Zero Dark Thirty, or Django Unchained, even though they had slimmer chances of winning than the hostages had of making it out alive.
3	how the critics gave this movie an 8 out of 10 is beyond me! i guess critics are into incredibly bland movies or they must've got paid to give this movie a high score! this movie drags; the dialogue is uninteresting, the pace drags, there is no suspense or thrills! the only thrill i got was the beginning of the movie and when theyre riding through the crowd of angry israel's! other than that though this movie was bland, dry, and devoid of any suspense or thrills! the only reason why im not giving this turd bomb a 0 out of 10 is because the popcorn they gave me at the theatre was damn good! i got more entertainment hearing the crunch of the popcorn as i chewed it! i got more entertainment out playing with my thumbs! 3 out of 10! the only postives i can give this movie is the beginning, the bus ride, and the popcorn i had while watching the movie! send this piece of back to the vagabonds of hell from whence it came from!
9	"Gone Baby Gone," "The Town," and now "Argo," Ben Affleck scores a hat trick with three acclaimed films that exhibit his impressive command behind the camera. Producing the film with George Clooney and Grat Heslov, who worked with Mr. Affleck for the award winning "Good Night, and Good Luck,â€? (2005) "Argo" is also based on history, with its fair share of dramatic license, that uniquely incorporates Hollywood during the tumultuous times of the Iran hostage crisis of the late 70's to early 80's. â€œArgoâ€? opens with a compelling re-creation of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Iran by militant students. It's November 4, 1979 and the world is about to change. Civilians force their way into the Embassy slowly, then, once the gates are forced open, in droves. Employees and diplomats rush to shred and incinerate all sensitive material before the building is completely overtaken. Six of them Bob Anders (Tate Donovan), Lee Schatz (Rory Cochrane), Mark and Cora Lijek (Christopher Denham and Clea DuVall), and Joe and Kathy Stafford (Scoot McNairy and Kerry Bishe) escape and make it to the residence of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber), where they are hidden for nearly 3 months. The State Department, helped by the CIA, decides to mount a rescue mission. By mid-January, concerns are rising that, if the diplomats aren't smuggled out of Iran, they may be captured and publicly executed. The Canadian government, concerned about the safety of the ambassador and his staff, is also applying pressure. CIA director Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) calls in agent Tony Mendez (Affleck), an infiltration expert, to devise a plan to get the six people out. The primary problem is that there is no viable reason why a half-dozen North Americans would be wandering Tehran. With the help of Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), Tony establishes a fake production company for a cheesy sci-fi movie called â€œArgo,â€? and devises a cover story that will hopefully allow them to pass through security at the airport and board a Swiss Air flight. â€œArgo,â€? is directed with flair and style by an admired actor/director, and as a period recreation it is just about flawless. There is a notable lack of on-screen bloodshed or violence, confident in its compelling story to invoke edge-of-your-seat tension. The movie has a surprisingly celebratory, feel-good tone rather than dwelling on any political overtones or commentary. The film is made to resemble something coming out of that era, integrating archive footage that lends authenticity to the retelling of the "Canadian Caper.â€? A closing-credits side-by-side montage shows to what lengths Affleck has gone to re-create the real-life places and people of "Argo,â€? and its his impressive command behind the camera the staging, editing, and the calibrated progression of the story, especially its harrowing final moments that solidifies Mr. Affleck as a talented and formidable director. "Argo" deserves to find the discerning audience it has been made for: After all, if we buy tickets, it hopefully leads to more intelligent, sophisticated filmmaking.
7	This movie was thrilling and an interesting story to be told in the form of film. Performances by the actors were incredibly convincing and the film was fantastically directed. Being unfamiliar with the subject matter however led to my disappointment when I realized the the movie made some changes from the original events. This was mainly to make the movie more tense, especially near the end of the movie, but alot of changes were made to increase the role of america in the event and diminish Canada's role and leave out the roles of countries like the UK and New Zealand completely. Overall if you ignore the fact that the movie is historically inaccurate then you've got a tense, enjoyable movie
8	Argo 8/10.............................................................................................................................................
5	A movie with some definite potential that didn't quite make it. There were some great scenes mixed in with some average which left me disappointed. Seemed very much a US propaganda piece that bastardized actual events. Are all middle-eastern men inherently evil? Are all American men misunderstood heros? The movie gave me this impression, from a non-partisan point of view it left a bitter taste.. especially with the perpetual war-hungry state the USA seems to be in. Congratulating the CIA? I think i need a shower. Some good cinematography and sets. Good acting in parts although i felt the movie dwelt on Affleck's character & the fake Hollywood studio too much.. the comedy moments seemed forced.
7	The idea is profoundly astonishing, and the reality that these events were reality, were even more astonishing. It's only downfall, unfortunately, is its bias towards the Americans. In general, I admire Ben Affleck as a director and producer, as well as John Goodman and Alan Arkin for the laughs they bring into the movie. The fake suspension makes the movie less banal, and for that I contemplate whether I like or hate it.
0	There should be restrictions on the use of the expression "Based on a true story" because in this case, lies far surpass what really happened. This movie represents everything that is shameful about American narcissism. This work has twisted the facts in favor of the U.S. image without respect for those who risked more than their reputations. I know it is a product of hollywood not considered a documentary, but if the goal is creating a fanciful story, it is better to let history undefiled. Finally, it is surprising that so many have acknowledged the work with so little knowledge (newspapers, academy awards). Canada, non-revolutionary Iranians, New-Zealand had way more to do with the results than Tony Mendez.
9	One of a kind movie! Ben Affleck does a great job directing and portraying the main character. You hold your breath every step of the way until the end. It's unbelievable that it was based on a true CIA story. It's a real life Mission Impossible. The movie contains every detail from the characters to the era fashion. Clean movie and historic film for the family to watch, no profanity or nudity.
5	Argo is a true story, so it`s amazing, but did not make for a great movie for me. It`s interesting, but did not blow me away, and I wouldn`t care much for it if it was all made up. I did find it watchable, and worth finishing for the movie rush at the end.
5	Not a bad film at all, does not fail to build massive tension throughout the end... but i was disappointed due the fact that this ends up in typical exaggerated american style "we are the good guys and we always win". It's great that they make films about historic events, but i think it's just an absolutely onesided view of events.
0	horrible display of american propaganda apart of that stiff very slow moving plot and uninteresting characters. Dont recommend it to anyone. Dont watch it but looks like no one has anyways judging by the number of rating this picture got.
8	Especially I won't forget the escape scene with aircraft from Iran. I feel the operation Argo, I feel like I am in this Argo operation now. It impressed me, I feel some complicated feels but this film is in my hits.
8	Argo balances suspense with fun and entertainment very well despite its slow pace. Although it falls short on expectations, it's old-school feel and tension escalates it from falling flat.
10	The third movie in direction for Ben Affleck brings the world of old fashioned thriller movie into 2012 which is about 6 Americans trapped in Iraq ,the movie is outstanding directing ,acting great script is just WOW!
9	I must say this movie is just amazing. I did not know about the Canadian Caper incident but now i know more than anything. This is Ben Affleck's Masterpiece and it is breathtaking. Ben plays the master of disguise Tony Mendez and is quite a performance. Every actor especially who plays the trapped civialians are truly good. no wonder it has won an Oscar for Best movie and Best Adapted screenplay Tense,dark,gloomy,clever and occasionally funny, it is so entertaining and not too long you would wonder how short it was. Alan Arkin really makes us laugh with his clever jokes . Cinematography is top-notch. The locations,sets and everything about this movie is so great. The climax is incredible so are the credits. R.I.P the victims and Praise the lord who sent a real hero to save those people and all the people who were on this case helping them. In Nutshell,Argo is masterpiece of modern film making. it makes us so happy so you cannot resist without saying "Argo f**k yourself.
6	Argo is for all intensive purposes one of the most over hyped films in quite sometime and given the fact that it is on the edge of being propaganda one can quickly realize why. While I applaud Afflek's continuing development as a director. This work aside from his direction is sub-par at best. Like all based on a true story films it is extremely loosely based, but the sheer fact that it is based on reality robs the movie of all suspense. Reality is fine for docudrama's but reality in terms of suspense is quite dull. Argo is a film that needs you to leave your brain at the door and hopes that you know not of things like history or something other ethnic stereotypes. From an entertainment standpoint that is usually a good choice in any film, check out and buy into what they are selling. However from a technical standpoint it creates films that falter. On Entertainment value I would give it a 7.5 On the Poe Scale however it gets a 6.5 Acting: 1/2 Cinematography: 1/2 Editing: 1.5/2 Effects and Design 1.5/2 Writing: 1.5/2
9	The buildup was a bit slow, but once it gets going, it's just awesome. It's thrilling, suspenseful, and well-directed. I mean, just think about the dialogue and the acting, and this movie really stands out.
8	Very tense and very well done. The directing was perfect to make the situation as tense and intense as it truly was. It was very entertaining and very interesting. However nothing about the film seemed particularly innovative or new. A good film, yes. Best picture worthy, questionable.
0	I don't understand why this has such great reviews. It was a boring as all hell patriotic American BS movie that drags along until the end. Boring story.
4	Ben Affleck's swift, skillful direction - including a fantastic opening sequence - fails to disguise the fact that "Argo" lacks any real style or substance, offering instead bland characterizations and caper cliches, not to mention gross historical inaccuracies that make this "epic" perilously close to a fabrication.
6	Cuando empece a verla en un principio me convenciÃ³, pero conforme avanza la historia se vuelve muy comercial con muchos tintes patriÃ³ticos, la verdad no sentÃ­ que los personajes estuvieran en un verdadero peligro, rescato los Ãºltimos minutos cuando estÃ¡n a punto de subir del aviÃ³n, en donde agarra tensiÃ³n, pero eso nada mas, ni la trama socio-polÃ­tica es muy buena, eso si tiene un buen montaje.
4	Interesting start Then comes abrupt stall somewhere between Hollywood and BBC So many usual hardships like divorced hero with a Son in shared custody far far away People do strange thing under duress but I am sure it wasn't like n this movie when embassy opens its doors because some officer wanted to reason with hostagetakers Couldn't bear it 4 only
8	So this is my first film that i have watched that Ben Affleck has directed. Though i do own the town i have not watched it yet. But now after watching this movie i will now have to find the time to watch that and also gone baby gone. So this film is about the 1979 true story of the rescue of six American's from Iran, while most the film has a really gritty serious tone as it should they do seem to place some dark humor in it... well as much as they could. The whole cast sold it from the start Ben Affleck/Alan Arkin/John Goodman/Bryan Cranston all just killed it but for me Alan Arkin stole the show everytime the guy is on the screen he steals it. The last half hour of the movie was so intense it's crazy pulse pounding nail biting tension i have not had that felling while watching a movie in some time well maybe just not to that extent. Now i can see how this film won best picture at the Oscars this year. Also i'm a bit mad at myself for not watching this film while it was still in theaters. A great film that everyone should at least take the time to give it a watch i don't regret watching it Overall i give this movie an 8.5 Oh Yeah Argo F**K Youself =D
9	This is a well done film by Ben Affleck who gives sharp direction and acting to this movie. It's triumphant and thrilling. Great performances from Affleck, Cranston, Alda, Goodman and the supporting cast
7	Argo is an good slow-growth film that caps with a fantastically tense ending. If you can stand a slower movie without things constantly exploding for you then you should absolutely see this movie.
8	Argo is the Academy Award Winner for Best Picture of 2012, and while it was an amazing film, the actual story was far less interesting. In 1980, the tensions between Iran and The United States began, and the U.S. embassy in Tehran was overrun. Hundreds were held hostage for over a year, but six did manage to escape and went into hiding. Knowing that their lives were even more in danger than those of the hostages, the C.I.A. developed a unique plan to get them out of Iran. They sent in one of their top agents, with credentials claiming that he was part of a Canadian film crew. Armed with fake documents, he would smuggled the six out of the country. The film was intense and featured one close call after another, but in reality, getting them out was almost too easy. They were never stopped or questioned, and slipped out under the cover of early morning, without a hitch, but what kind of a movie would that be? Once these classified files were released by the U.S. Government, Hollywood saw the chance to tell this story in an extreme manor, and did so much to the delight of audiences and much to the chagrin of the other countries involved. Ben Affleck both stars and directs this film, and while everyone raves about his performance, I thought it was typically cold and flat. Ben Affleck wasn't interesting, the character he played was. Affleck wasn't any more likeable or skillful here than he was in any other role and that's why he didn't win best actor. I've said it before and I'll say it again, the man is a fantastic Director, but a very mediocre actor. That being said, the extreme locations and huge cast, were his biggest challenge to date as a Director, and I was very impressed by the way he managed to pull it off. Argo is based on a true story, it's fast paced, and even though we all know what happened before seeing the film, it's still an edge of your seat thriller that really shouldn't be missed.
8	Affleck has directed and crafted one of the best films of not only this year, but of his entire career. This film manages to take a true story and turn it into a masterpiece.
8	Argo balances suspense with fun and entertainment very well despite its slow pace. Although it falls short of Oscar winning expectations, it's old-school feel and tension escalates it from falling flat.
9	'If we're going to make a fake movie, we're going to make a fake hit!' Mr. Affleck, you've made a real one, an authentic masterpiece, which, even if some parts of the story were emebellished, paints a wonderful portrait of the human spirit. Combining geeky sci-fi ideas and spy like knowledge, one of the most unlikely heists imaginable is undertaken. As mentioned though, this is not only about effects and jargon- it's about cunning, brains, teamwork and above all enormous courage against all odds. Affleck for me, not only delivers a career director's performance but acts superbly as well. The best film of the year; great scenery, cultural and historical context and wit. 9.5/10
6	As neither an American nor a Canadian citizen, I get to watch this movie for what it is: a movie. If we consider it a crime film, it doesn't have a twisted enough plot. If we consider it a thriller, there's not enough tension. If we consider it a documentary, it's not true enough. Where are the laughs the critics are talking about? When are supposed to laugh? If we consider it a comedy, it doesn't make you laugh enough. I understand it's a celebration of the American intelligence and it is intelligently released in a period where pretty much all of the Western World looks at Arabic countries with suspicion. I didn't know anything about the Canadian Caper and honestly, this film didn't make me curious about it. Ben Affleck was in 2012, so that meant no facial expressions, and I get it. He did the same in To The Wonder. A notable yet tiny performance by Cranston is worth mentioning, the rest of the cast were blank pawns. The score, despite being Alexandre Desplat and all, I found irritating. Not a bad movie, but not a great one either. It certainly doesn't deserve that 86. The political gets too much in the way to judge Argo without prejudice.
8	Smart, tense and well directed, "Argo" succeeds not just as a great movie but as a realistic political thriller that keeps audience entertained for 2 hours.
7	Argo has great direction and acting, and builds up a thrilling and convincing piece of history. Despite accusations of inaccuracy and nationalism (even though the film only focuses on one small, isolated group of people undergoing a minor operation), this is still a very intense and gripping story that shouldn't be passed up.
9	Argo is the film that made me think why are people worried that Ben Affleck is playing batman because this film is beyond brilliant. i loved every second of it's amazing true plot, great acting from a all star cast ( special mention to john goodman, Alan Arkin, Bryan Cranston and Scoot McNairy) and one of the most suspenseful endings i've seen. for once my pick for best picture at the oscars has actually won
3	The only thing good about Argo is the fact that its based on a true story, but it obviously does not stop the fact that Ben Affleck is a bad actor and that Arabians speaking frantically is extremely annoying. This movie is great if you can get past Ben Afflecks acting and annoying Arabians acting like imbeciles. To keep it short and sweet like everyone should on this site, if you don't care for the true story don't watch it. If you do watch it, watch it. Then stop watching it and turn on something worth watching.
10	I can barely believe how good this movie is. It may not be necessarily perfect, but it's got so many great things going on. The acting is impeccable, the direction is great... but the standout is definitely the plot, the story. It's got such suspense and it's so entertaining that you soon forget the notion that "Argo" may sound like a boring film. Quite the opposite actually.
8	Based on real events, this movie is about an agent going in to extract six Americans who are trapped in Iran. Their only way out is to pretend they were looking for locations for a Star Wars rip off called "Argo." Most of the movie felt realistic and the acting was well done. The story may sound boring to some but I'd still encourage those people to watch it because it's actually quite interesting.
9	Original and sweet and interesting narrative style and directing, and at first I was not 'sold' on the structure, but then I loved how they did a split screen - reality v expectations and it was SO creative. Its a bittersweet romcom but superior to many, many others.
10	I absolutely adore this movie. It is entirely original, no matter what anyone says. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel were great as the doomed lovers, though I began to hate Summer as the movie progressed.
9	Brilliant film - cringeworthy in parts (for a man who had his heartbroken in similar fashion), ecstatic in parts (for a man who too has tried to impress women by drunkenly singing indie classics) and with a fantastic soundtrack throughout. The 2 leads are captivating & enigmatic throughout.
10	It's a travesty that this movie has a lower score on metacritic than District 9. You won't be disappointed by seeing it.
9	im a dude and i have to say i loved this movie. holy shit i expected less. this isn't cliched at all it's a love story but it isn't because the boy meets the girl then loses her and the end was the best she replied "autumn."
9	Ultimately this movie was painful. Both leads are exceptional actors and because of this I really felt the pain with Tom as he navigated through this doomed stretch of time known as 500 Days of Summer. I'm glad he was willing to give the idea of destiny a second chance, but for many people his experience would just be too painful to let go quickly. Summer was a dream. So much that Tom was lead blindly and he paid the price. She really was a dream.
9	It was a little difficult to bear this movie after the breakup. From the beginning, the viewer knows that the relationship between Tom and Summer is doomed (although, there is hope in tom trying to win her back) It wasn't until a good way through the movie that I was really enchanted by summer. Their relationship is depicted so well that it is difficult to realize its inevitable downfall. I wasn't extremely fond of the theme about fate, which basically sums up the ending. I was only mildly satisfied by the ending, but even still, this movie is extremely memorable. As for those who say its corny or cliche, I dont even begin to see that. I would recommend anybody to watch this movie.
9	I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie with a girl you aren't confident about, because ultimately the movie is about where fate falls (that's practically a pun! sly winks abound) won't be/feel the same for all people. Also, the NPR review is complete bullshit. What is it actually deriding? I think it's basically somehow saying its not genuine, somehow more like a Jennifer Anisten flick, but this movie was entirely more effective and brilliantly shining.
6	A bit overrated to be honest.Too gimmicky and the characters aren't particularly interesting.
10	After 2/3 of this movie I wondered what the hype was about. It seemed like standard fare, maybe a bit boring. Then it all came together. Striking message about life, love, and how feelings don't necessarily match reality. Very hopeful ending - funny, uplifting. Levitt's acting was fantastic throughout.
9	Finally a romantic comedy that isn't corny and can relate to everyone. Plus a brilliant screenplay and brilliant acting. I gave it a 9 because it felt too "hipster" to relate to audiences, I mean Zooey Deschanel as Summer Fin? That's a little typecasting...
10	Awesome movie,my favourite of all time.Better than Avatar!(In my opinion).
8	Fun movie that doesn't end the way every romantic comedy ends, which makes it all the more enjoyable. I really enjoy Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this, he does quite a good job.
8	I tend to stay away from romantic comedies but this one really got to me. Sure it's a little cliche, but it was charming, and realistic. I really loved it.
9	Ironically, the perfect date movie turns out to be a film about some of the more negative aspects of love, the heartbreak and rejection, the confusion and hurt and yet remains a joy to watch. The characters feel more like old friends, whose situations are so real that augments their highs and makes you empathise with their lows. Well written, well acted, well done.
10	One of the more memorable movies I've seen in the past year. It had a nice tone and sort of a "real life" feel to it, when it comes to relationships (beyond the fantasy elements in the movie). Not a love story, but a relationship story. Excellent filmmaking.
10	No one really quite knows the exact reasons why there relationship ends or how it ended in the first place or why it came to end the way it did. All we know is that the relationship is over and there is nothing we can do about it they have moved on so should we however, that is sometimes easier said that done. Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) knows this all too well as h e has just broken up with his loveless, girlfriend Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). He is wreck after there break-up he has lost his kind nature and feels disjointed and lost in the world like he has had his heart ripped out and had her do the Mexican hat dance all over it. Tom is depressed and lonely but thanks to his friends (Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler) and an extraordinarily smart little girl who seems to be an expert on relationships (Chloe Moretz). Tom looks back on the 500 days of his relationship with Summer trying to find out what went wrong and what he could have done differently if he only had a second chance. There is a scene of dialogue that opens this film stating, "This is not a love story, this is a story about love" and that is the entire basis for this film story. This is not a love story a love story is where you see a sequences of events and happenings that lead two people to find one another. Then in a big mush climax they admit there love for one another while the poignant and very sappy music plays in the background while the girl finally finds her knight in shining armor or the boy finally finds his princess. It is a tried and rundown formula that has plagued the romance genre for the last 30 years, now here we are in the 21st century and we still get these sappy and at some points very cringe inducing conclusions to these clichÃ© love stories that makes audiences scoff, scoff because they have seen it hundreds thousands of times before. "(500) Days of Summerâ
10	Maybe a â
9	I like how it focuses on the guys side of the relationship where he realizes that he should be paying more attention. There was some fantasy, but it was mild.
10	Is this, romantic-comedy, is not a perfect 10 i don't what it is? this movie is the best you can expect for a romantic-comedy and more!! Acting is good, cinematography original and beautiful, music great and its a honest love story that show us what is love and motivate us to go on. Best romantic film since Eternal Sunshine. submit
8	The title on thiz movie, Summer eventually is the girl name. The truth is no one escaped from love, either Tom and Summer. I think thiz is the best modern romantic drama since ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004). The couple played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. We see Gordon-Levitt recently in G.I. JOE: RISE OF COBRA (2009). The Director is Marc Webb. The chemistry of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel was very well. The characters seem so easy-going and believable. The movie fills with good music as well, to describe the high and low of love. The movie simply brings us into the mood of love easily, where sometimes fill with laugh and joy, and the other times with hesitation and sadness. In several of scenes, they keep asking each other, where this relationship goes to? If you love somebody that just happens and you can tell her anytime, anywhere, do not care where the place it is. Maybe do not that simple, but we know even love does not last forever, but commitment does. The ending is far from idealistic, but more close to reality. Like I said many times before, if you want to make a great love story, you cannot have the couple stay together in the ending. You can see thiz element from ROMEO AND JULIET to TITANIC and other similar love stories. The essential of love is the moments we ever had.

9	This is probably the only romantic comedy I've seen to date that I have been able to fully relate to. It's clear a huge amount of research when into peoples' relationships and Marc Webb was able to make a movie which had morals, as well as moments in which you can sit back and laugh at because you've been in a similar situation. The editing style was amazing and we've seen this with Marc Webb's music videos (REF: Move Along, Bad Day & 21 Guns). He loves experimenting with different editing styles and it paid off. By jumping backwards and forwards between different dates from the 500 days, it was a different way of telling a story and revealing vital parts of the plot to the audience as it went on. Overall, a very good film and one I will no doubt watch over and over again...
10	one of the best in 2009, its ending was totally unexpected. Its cleaver dialog and script makes 500 days of summer one of the best romantic comedy's of all year and maybe of all time. Both leads play there part perfectly as i believed them 100% of the movie. Just the way they told the story was something i have never seen in movies before, i though it would get confusing skipping from day 352 to 2 but it didn't as the director made it work perfectly it added a really good twist to the movie.
7	One of the movie's goals appears to have been to examine how love/a relationship works. Unfortunately, the script writer appears to have not spend enough time researching social philosophy on that topic (f.i. writings of Erich Fromm). Thereafter, the movie misses to make a clear distinction between infatuation and real love/earnest friendship. Furthermore, it completely leaves out the possibility that two people really just might have to work together and have some tolerance for each others flaws. Rather "(500) Days of Summer" suggests that love is something totally random and that a relationship either works perfectly or simply not. Because of this, the "(500) Days of Summer" contributes to keeping alive the fairy tale idea that there is one - and only one - perfect lover in the world for each single person. Nevertheless, the movie does a good job on one of its other goals, which is to encourage the viewer to not follow the trend of striving for quick money, but to follow one's real passion by bringing it to the center of one's life. Lastly, "(500) Days of Summer" is good filmmaking, tastefully combining romance, drama, and short scenes amplifying emotions of the protagonists like a funny musical interlude or beautiful 2-D animation.
7	Funny real life scenario, I could see this happening all over the world. It bounces around in days of the relationship and you find yourself laughing but yet its also serious and moving, very good flick to watch with the lady, or maybe not, ;)
9	This movie is superb by all means. Modern relationships are often misguided opinions and the inability to be truly intimate. Additionally, talking and listening are core elements, because a relationship is difficult. 500 Days of Summer, excels because it presents how society is now a days. Everyone goes on parading something that they feel, and love, when truly it is something they don't quite understand yet, and these are driven by simple infatuations or a blind emotion devoted to not seeing the truth as it is presented. Many of us are in relationships we don't understand, but we still go at it. Why? The movie presents this remarkably well and tells the consequences in flashback sequences. Ultimately though, it ends on a positive note. A must watch, for its light touch of comedy and dramatic effect towards the end.
1	the most depressing movie i have seen in a long time. if you want to see a guy be depressed for 90 minutes and have his heart torn out of his ass, this is the movie for you.
9	Too often compared to the neo-quirky comedies of Wes Anderson and the smart-teen dialogue of "Juno," "500 Days of Summer" is a singularly original comedy in its own right that deserves recognition for brilliant direction, writing, and editing, as well as the wonderful performances from leads and supporting players. A new twist on old formulas, this feature from music video director Marc Webb doesn't pander to the audience's expectations, and recognizes that drama must coincide with laughs.
10	My favorite movie. A work of art. I never wanted it to end. Best picture, best soundtrack, best cast, best script, BEST MOVIE EVER of its genre. It is so beautifully crafted and it's not like all those sappy romantic comedies. Just like the narrator says at the very beginning, "This is not a love story. This is a story about love."
8	Interesting the tematic of the movie. It reveals very good the sentiment which many people live: fear of getting involved and getting hurt (especially after two traumatic experiences or even in their own household). But if do not get involved how to know it? Life is so short... is it worth your time hiding behind a supposed protective security?
8	No romantic comedy is truly original or inspiring. This movie, however, does contain great acting, kept me laughing throughout, contained witty dialogue, and left me satisfied, if not entirely content, with the execution and and ending.
10	The Millenial's "When Harry Met Sally." Does a good job at articulating what modern love, dating, and heartbreak feels like, is well written, and has a beautiful aesthetic that remains consistent throughout the entire film.
8	A very cleverly written film with a fantastic cast. All the characters compliment each other so well and such witty rhetoric. You quickly fall in love with Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) ever since the beginning. You see Summer (Zooey Deschanel) as such the nice lovely lady and that's exactly what she is. You begin to feel extremely compassionate for Tom when things begin to not go his way. The film takes you through a series of 500 days, hence the title. It jumps back and forth between days at the beginning and towards the end of the relationship showing when things were going good and then when things began to get sour. At times they would show the same circumstances at the beginning and end of the relationship and the noticeable differences. This is a fantastic film anyone who appreciates good film.
8	This romantic comedy manage the rare feat of telling a realistic story of falling in and out of love. The movie cleverly shakes up the formulas genre by, among other things, showing the story in a non-chronological order. This, along with the likability of its leads, holds the viewer's interest throughout the movie
8	This is a great movie, This movie has a great plot, great cinematography, great cast, and great use of music. This movie is without spoiling a realistic romantic comedy. It is indeed an incredible film even though romantic comedies in general suck and are predictable this movie stands out. The movie has a non linear use of plot which is extremely cool. The great shots ans use of color are great. The music overall stood out. The choice of music was great, with the combination of certain effects like muting the movie really does create emotions. I really enjoyed this movie and suggest you see it if you dislike or are bored of the normal unrealistic romantic comedy.
6	This film is unique and well-acted. Gordon-Levitt gives a very good performance here Deschanel is good but there's nothing new when compared to her past roles. Initially, it is difficult to get familiarized with the back and forth nature of storytelling, but eventually it settles in. However, in the end, this is just another tedious, dramatic, quirky, love story genre-film that has been unfairly watered down by all of it's cheesy predecessors.
7	(500) Days of Summer is exactly what it's billed: an entertaining and sometimes very funny indie comedy. If you have 95 minutes to spend and aren't sure how, this movie would be a great choice.
9	This is probably the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. Its dialogue and emotion is so much more real than almost all others. Even if that wasn't the case, the movie would've been saved by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, anyway
9	Beautifully acted and smartly written romantic comedy.500 Days is a real departure from the norm of the genre.It cleverly avoids every cliche and is completely unsentimental.Zooey Deschanel is adorable and funny while also showing real depth.Joseph Gordon Levitt is also very impressive.It's believable and refreshing.The soundtrack is impeccable and the whole movie is refreshingly honest.One of the best romantic comedies of recent times.
9	Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Zooey Deschanel were the perfect choices to play the roles of Tom and Summer. This is one of the best romantic comedies ever being made. And the ending was so ironic, like the girl name was autumn, ahahahaha it's funny. Overall it was a good movie, but i though that the movie should have been more recognize awards wise,
10	This film is the perfect romantic comedy-drama. After hundreds of formulaic romcoms, with poor acting, and poor scriptwriting, a film comes along that's sweet, funny, a little sour in places, clever and wonderfully performed. If you only watch one romcom in your life, this is the one.
10	Wonderful. Real. Funny, Creative. New. Terrific performances. Unique. This film was one of the most pleasant surprises I've seen in years. The leads are wonderful and the direction is well-paced. Here's hoping for more big-screen work from all involved.
10	One of the best romantic comedies I've seen ever and one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. Zooey and Joseph are great as the two leads. It's painfully funny and sad to watch the ups and down of this very modern relationship. The structure of the plot is originally creative and interesting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is turning into one of the most sought after actors at the moment.
3	Another very long movie with a long drama in which at the end anything happens, not a love story so this movie is nothing, is simply stupid, i really waste my time watching this
9	Those who can relate to the central meaning of 500 Days of Summer will LOVE IT, those who do not relate will miss it's point. As the movie announces - 500 days is NOT a movie about love, its a movie about a wuss/confused modern male coming to terms with reality. The movies soundtrack is awesome; its visuals are meaningful and interesting. There are some great scenes throughout that I believe are some of the most memorable in recent popular movies. 500 days is not perfect as it does start to drag during its 3rd quarter but I believe is one of the best movies in recent years.
5	I don't know what to think about this movie. The ending was **** sincerely. I don't know if I should laugh or mourn with this movie. Strange, is'n it?
2	Light, easy watching but so predictable I lost interest very quickly... my wife liked it so maybe there's hope for this film yet. I'm now just adding characters as this film is uninspiring.
10	500 Days of Summer is an original, hilarious, sweet, charming romantic comedy that isn't cliche at all and benefits from the fantastic and charming performances from Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gorden- Levit. I give this film 98%.
10	Loved this movie. Intelligent and witty, creative and fun. It's the only chick flick that I've ever seen and I have to say it's quite good. Extremely good.
10	Best romantic comedy of all time to me. It may not have the cliche ending that everyone desires but this is life. Happy endings do not occur on a daily basis. A very strong and compelling performance from the cast, every single one of them although joseph gordon-levitt and zooey deschanel deserve honorable mention. Direction of the movie plus the cinematography was excellent to say the least. soundtrack was played to its strengths too. The script was brilliantly written too, no nonsense corny **** which is another plus point. highly recommended.
8	500 Days of Summer is misnamed as a romantic comedy, because is neither romantic or comedy, although is treats the development of love in a couple, contrasting and comparing the woman with the man; it is so depressing, that at times is no longer enjoyable. As to the comedy; this picture is more about drama, which means that the goal is to make the viewer identify with the situation. As this is not a happy ending story, the movie tries to show how foolish we become when being blindly in love; in other words this film makes a satire of love. According to the picture a person in this situation will forgive everything, will remember all the happy moments but not the sad ones and wont listen any warning. The ending is remarkable because both lovers end up believing what the other thought about life in the beginning of the relationship; Tom stopped believing in destiny, happy endings and fairy tale stories; and Summer stopped believing in coincidences, a existence without love and with no possibility of dreaming. 500 Days of Summer has an interesting plot, script and performances, but I think that the one of Zooey Deschanel is more suitable for the movie than the one of Joseph Gordon Levitt. Up next is autumn.
6	This is such a cute, romantic, sad with an nice ending. Loved both characters. Zoey played such a classic, indie & vintage-kind-of girl which makes her so likable & unique. Gordon, as usual, expressed his emotions well. I like how their relationship ended mysteriously & the way they depict the number of days to their screenplay.
10	The screenplay is genuinely written, and the story doesn't stop from surprising us during the hole movie with its twists and turns. But the thing is, people who watched it easily do projections on their emotional life which is normal because of nature of the story that shows us another dark and bitter side of our human condition witch is pretty disappointing for those people, and yet completely true. It is actually a very bright and cheerful movie to show the sadness that a man can go through somewhere in his life.
10	I loved this movie. I think everyone could relate to the story. I loved the spontaneity of the characters. I liked the part when Summer was sitting on the bench. I liked the conversations between Summer and Tom. I liked most of the lines. I just want to say that the writers of this movie were amazing.
8	Amazing movie. It's funny, charming and even a little sad at times. Joe and Zooey did an amazon job. I've seen this movie countless times, and I'll always watch it again!
0	A truly awful movie. Utterly without point and extremely boring it will literally feel like its been 500 days by the time you have finished watching it. Truly one of the worst movies i have ever seen.
10	I love this movie. That is all I can say.
8	(500) days of summer â
8	D'emblÃ©e, on pourrait s'attendre, comme tout film romantique amÃ©ricain, Ã  une guimauve hollywoodienne. Et la couleur se montre bien diffÃ©rente dÃ¨s la note du rÃ©alisateur (affichÃ©e avant le dÃ©but du film). DÃ¨s lors, on sait que l'on assiste Ã  une comÃ©die romantique fantaisiste. Oui, c'est bien le mot qui convient ! On n'Ã©chappe pas aux inÃ©vitables moments tristes, mais (500) jours ensemble esquive tous les clichÃ©s du genre, grÃ¢ce Ã  sa construction en "puzzle" (on passe de la journÃ©e 350 Ã  la 1 puis on revient Ã  la 180 puis Ã  la 3...) Ã©tonnamment cohÃ©rente (servant Ã  des comparaisons sur la situation du couple) et qui donne un cÃ´tÃ© comique bienvenu, son scÃ©nario (rien ne se passe comme on pourrait le deviner dans un autre film du genre). Et que dire des acteurs, en tout cas le couple vedette (Joseph Gordon-Levitt- Zooey Deschanel), Ã  part qu'ils sont naturels, dÃ©contractÃ©s et talentueux? Non, franchement, (500) jours ensemble est une bien belle petite surprise qui se regarde avec dÃ©lice.
7	(500) DAYS was quite an entertaining film, on the other hand. The performance of Zooey Deschanel provides enough chutzpah and energy to hold up an entire film on its own. Tom, as well, is an interesting character to watch. His performance gets a rise out of an audience with the most minute effort. In one scene, there is an off camera person interviewing Tom and his three friends about what love means to each of them. Both of Tomâ
9	As a movie, it's a great one. You think is just a new movie about love, but it's not. It's really different from the others and perspective from love really changes. Particularly, I really love it. Emphasis on the perfomances of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel.
10	500 days of summer is an impressive story about dorian-gray-thinking woman, looking for new sensations. And Tom is an only new sensation continouing 500 days of summer.
9	One of those films where you genuinely care about the characters. In a day when most rom-coms are cheap and manipulative 500 days of summer deals with big themes and executes it perfectly with it's flawless ending.
5	Despite the film's best intentions, I didn't think this had potential to reflect on the idea of what love is when it ended. The contrast of blue skies and dark clouds ended in a blurry mess. The film was a little light for my liking, preferring to not explain the circumstances surrounding what was actually going on between the two main characters. I like both of the actors, but their cute looks gave me more a sense of confusion between seriousness and cheerfulness. Was it supposed to be this confusing, or does this genuinely try and portray complications within a relationship, if you could call what they were going through a relationship? I felt it was quite an arty interpretation, though, with plenty of light-hearted humour. But never ever could this assume that it was trying to preach a message about love, because it wasn't.
10	One of the smartest, funniest, and heartfelt movies I've ever seen. Marc Webb's direction always feels creative but never gimmicky. (500) Days of Summer is one of the most relatable and emotionally resonant movies I've seen, and one of my all-time favorites.
9	Loved this film! Acting was excellent and the storyline was lovely, there was also an excellent pun at the end of the film! Perfect for when your feeling down or if you want a good giggle with friends!
8	A consistently amiable tale about love and break-ups. Untypical for its genre but ironically the movie does everything right nevertheless. Lovely for couples, singles and recently abandoned ones. Worth watching!
9	One of the best, most original movies of the year.
9	An irresistibly charming, brilliantly uncommon romantic drama featuring two truly great lead performances layered on top of some really intriguing lead characters.
10	If you are building the relationship you hope will last forever watch this movie at least twice. Girls? Don
9	This movie is completely infectious. It will have you laughing and loving the characters in a matter of seconds. Most certainly one of the much more original and better romantic comedies out there.
9	â€œ(500) Days of Summerâ€? is a simple story about destiny and true love. However, this little romantic-comedy takes it a little further. It becomes a more real and honest story about taking chances and moving on with life. One relationship isnâ€™t the end all be all. The film manages to be simple while having a complex script. It tackles the ups and downs, the glorification of certain moments in a relationship, and its aftermath. The film is quit complex, but the humor is funny with the right amount of quirkiness. Director Marc Webb manages to balance everything from the humor to the heart break with great subtlety. It is a very grounded film, but the direction takes everything to a more wonderful place. The way the story jumps back and forth between time periods is handled well. I really enjoy the original shots the movie has, especially the reality vs. expectation one. The script is incredibly smart. There are so many great laughs placed throughout the film, but nothing becomes over the top and unnatural. I really enjoy this film for itâ€™s quirkiness and incredibly smart writing. The actors do a fine job in their roles. Joseph Gordon-Levitt brings a lot of subtlety and warmth to his character. Heâ€™s incredibly likable and we root for him till the very end. Heâ€™s dorky, but relateable. Zooey Deschanel is the every girl. Sheâ€™s quirky, fun, and almost perfect in every way. However, sheâ€™s hard and blunt. When she does something wrong, itâ€™s hard for the audience to be upset with her for too long because she manages to be so sweet. From the main characters to the side characters, the cast gives true and honest performances. Overall â€œ(500) Days of Summerâ€? is a genuinely great film. Itâ€™s touching, cheesy, funny, and oh so very creative in its execution. There are some really nice moments and the script is inventive. The main cast only brings more delight on screen. The film has a great soundtrack that only elevates every sequence. Marc Webbâ€™s direction brings everything together in a quirky, fun, and enjoyable way that feels refreshing. Couple everything with a dance number and you got yourself a real winner. I give it 4.5/5, honest and fun story telling at its finest. â€œFetch Statusâ€?
8	A well written, well directed and well performed film. Even though the film didn't always click it still captured something spectacular between the two main characters. A movie that is funny, touching, and very honest.
10	Amazing film!, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are so good in this. Both are excellent actors. The film is a romantic comedy about the relationship of a girl who doesn't believe in true love while JGL's character does and wants something more from her. With the story unfolds as he retells their times together.
9	I love this film so much. The way it looks at how different people feel in the same relationship. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zoey Deschanel show great on screen chemistry.
10	A lot of people were mad because this movie is "depressing". Frankly that doesn't make sense. It's not SUPPOSED to be a happy movie. It has very good acting, some very funny lines, and a wonderful soundtrack. And if you've ever been through heartbreak, you'd understand its not exactly a happy thing. Everyone has had a Summer. Its unfortunate but true. Those who haven't had a Summer just haven't met her yet. This is very much a "For Emma Forever Ago" as a movie. Love love love it.
10	Lovely bitter-sweet comedy about Tom, a guy who believes in love at first sight and Summer who apparently does not. The plot and characters are believable, and the movie is edited in a clever way. We follow some of the most important moments of the Tom/Summer relationship (and break-up) in a non-linear sequence, which for once improves the story. Moreover, the movie is interspersed with quirky scenes (the black & white "movie" Tom watches after the break-up; the dance scene and scored with brilliant music. Romantic comedies are hardly ever this good and watchable. It does not hurt that Tom and Summer are played by actors likable and good looking, but in an ordinary way more than in a Hollywood superstar way. It is funny to note that some male reviewers hated the Summer character, describing her as a "tease" often using more impolite words. In fact, Summer is honest and straightforward. She is adamant with Tom about not wanting a serious relation and Tom accepts this condition. Unfortunately, when it comes to feelings, how can you really assure anybody that you will not fall madly in love? That is Summer's mistake: expecting Tom to accept a carefree relationship, when nobody can really foresee how deeply they will love somebody else. But can she be called a tease for that? Tom, harbouring his notion of the "perfect match" is living in an illusion of his own making. He gets obsessed about the fact that Summer is that perfect match and blames her for not living up to his expectations. In fact, Summer herself falls into the love trap, showing that even the best intentions can crumble down unexpectedly and the girl who did not want a serious relationship ends up married. That is what real life is about, illogical and vastly unforeseeable.
6	Don't get me wrong, I did like the film, but it seemed to me like it was trying too hard to be "indie and cool". It felt like a Hi-Fidelity wannabe (mentioning all the indie cool bands, and adding some great ones to the soundtrack) without actually getting there. The fact that I found Summer extremely annoying and self-centered didn't help either. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one to look out for in the future he was excellent in this film. He made you sympathise with the plight of his character. I especially enjoyed the way the film was directed the way it jumped from past to present and back again. It was a good romantic comedy and yet it left me with a feeling that it was lacking a certain something which would have made it suburb.
9	Charming movie and our two leads, Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are more than capable of holding things together and why they continue to be among my favorite young actors years after seeing this (did see it when it came out in 2009). It's not the usual romantic comedy as there's nothing dumb about it. Yes, you do get a happy ending, but not the one you'd expect. Highly recommend.
9	Whenever I see a romantic drama, I always feel overwhelmed by the cheesy atmosphere that exists between loves ones. I doubted a long time about seeing "(500) Days of Summer", and as a big Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan, I decided to watch it, and I don't regret a single thing. Just like in "50/50", Gordon-Levitt manages to hit the emotional strings every single time, because he mirrors his character so very well. Although "50/50" left me with tears of joy, "(500) Days of Summer" left me with a bright smile on my face. The movie is funny, heartwarming, touching and emotional throughout, but especially the last few moments completely wrapped my heart in a cocoon of happiness and hope.
8	Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the lovely Zooey Deschanel (500) Days of Summer manages to breath fresh life into the cliched romantic comedy genre. Told in non-chronological order each scene begins on a different day of the relationship. Jumping from their happiest moments to times of despair makes for a fascinating watch despite the fact that we learn right from the start of the film how things will eventually turn out. Unusually told from the male leads perspective (500) Days of Summer also maintains a healthy sense of humour throughout, even during some of the movies darker moments, and this largely prevents it from becoming over sentimental in the way other romantic movies have been prone to do. It is all too easy to dismiss this type of movie out of hand but this is certainly offers something just a little bit different.
10	I loooove coming into a film with absolutely no expectations (all I knew about the film was the title) and leaving thinking that you have spent an hour-and-a--half very profitably indeed. Joseph Gorden-Levitt is a great actor and it is rewarding to see him finally get a film to himself after playing second fiddle in soooo many blockbusters. Zooey Duhamel is radiant but in a way that leaves you thinking "do I really like this girl or is she the devil incarnate?"
7	This movie is unique and not like any other love story, which gives it a diversity and a different sort of recognition within the film community, highly recommended
7	It had its moments. I could not shake off the feeling that it could have been much better, but just missed it somehow. There were quite a few laughs. But it failed miserably to make me care about any of the characters. And frankly, I'm sick and tired of the haphazard storytelling. If there is any substance in a script, it would work just fine even with a linear narrative.
8	A refreshing Summer breeze Starring Joseph Gordon Levitt as Tom; an Architect who writes greeting cards for a living. And Zooey Deschanel as Summer, an average girl who doesn't believe in love. (500) Days of Summer directed by Marc Webb, Provides a refreshing experience to an audience that's over saturated with romantic comedies. Where most follow the same general plot line of, for example Friends with Benefits directed by Will Gluck, of boy meets girl (or the other way around) they fall in love, there love is tested but ultimately wins in the end. (500) Days of Summer in fact does follow this plot format but it differs in two key different ways. It tells the ending upfront, which is they don't end up together, and acknowledges that the rest is predicable. So what the movie does is, it delivers the story non-linearly, which makes the story feel fresh even though its one that we have seen a dozen times. An important thing to note is that the goal of the movie is not to show a story about people falling in love and getting married. Its to capture what its like to have had a relationship, from the â€œholy **** moment to the inevitable â€œyour still my best friendâ€?. (500) Days of Summer, gives its audience a new experience by highlighting the range of emotions felt through the course of a relationship. Not the â€œmovie fairy taleâ€? we have all come to expect too see, and struggle to relate too. Its a must watch for anyone in the mood for something that shows its audience something new, but still feels familiar to everyone.
9	Controversial to usual romantic comedies, 500 Days of Summer is a very honest movie. It tells us right from the start that it's not a love story. Its originality and the actors' performances constructs all of its charm.
8	5oo Days of Summer is an absolutely fantastic tale of a relationship gone wrong. The performances are excellent and the script is pretty much spot on. We've probably all been through the hell that Tom experiences in this movie. The only downside; that annoyingly cliched little sister.
8	When I first saw the title, I thought itâ€™s a story about a guy spending time with a girl for 500 days, which felt Summer to him. I am somehow correct after watching the movie. It is about a guy spending time with a girl named Summer for 500 days. The movie had an amazing cinematography, editing and direction. It was brilliantly visualized and it had its eye candy moments. The chemistry between Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel is excellent. The characters they played, Tom and Summer made them feel like theyâ€™re a real couple without making them a rom-com couple. The script from the brilliant screenwriters of The Fault in Our Stars and The Spectacular Now is really great and hence, why the visual art and the direction in this movie is amazing. The plot and the concept is very clever and I could relate to it verywell. I relate to Tom so badly based on my own experience with a crush that I am no longer speaking terms with. And the plot twist where Summer is now married felt like a knife stabbed into my heart. I felt really bad for Tom and I see himself there as well. The humor is the highlight of this movie and the comedic timing in this perfect for a movie like this. Overall, I would love to see this movie again and again because it had the feels and the light-heartening moments with brillaint script, clever plot and amazing chemistry between the movieâ€™s stars.
8	500 Days Of Summer is a very intelligent romantic comedy-drama that has its own art. Unlike most romantic comedies it ends and starts in a unique and wise way, also nice acting from Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel
9	Its one of the best movies I have seen in sometime. The character Tom resembled a lot like me and the character Summer resembled exactly like my Ex. I just love this movie.
8	(500) Days of Summer may dive into a year and a half relationship between a boy and a girl--however, this is not a love story. This film is the story of finding yourself through others along the way. Michael H. Weber and Scott Neustadter kick off their screenwriting partnership in a great way. And bravo to Zooey Deschanel!
8	(500) Days of Summer is a very unique movie. It is funny and awe-inspiring, you can't say it is a romance movie because it is actually not, but a story of two friends that are in and out of love.
3	Don't waste two hours of your life; watch Walter Mitty instead. Overrated, hackneyed and predictable. This film made me cringe so often.Two fine actors fail to save a hapless script. Setting is poor and square at best. The time shifts don't have the desired effects as the dialogue is way too repetitive, typical yuppie stereotypes. The whole guy who has no chance with a beautiful woman thing has been done countless times. Music was all right.
8	Wise, charming and wholly unusual, "500 Days of Summer" is thankfully helped by competent performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, and Marc Webb's confident directing.
9	So, I've fallen in love with this film. Truly, it was love at first sight, so maybe fate is a real thing? Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Zooey Deschanel, and Chloe Grace Moretz, are all awesome in this funny, touching, and moving, little "romantic" comedy that manages to capture the feeling of wanting somebody who doesn't want you so well and for that, it makes it all feel so authentic. The direction and writing here are stellar and, ugh, for a movie that is not supposed to be romantic, it all just feels so romantic, which I guess is the point, that it is a bit of tease in a way. As a whole, 500 Days of Summer is a depressing, happy, and above all, enjoyable roller coaster of emotions that hit me like a ton of bricks in a deep and personal way and for that, I loved this film.
9	"I found a woman with a perfect body but not a perfect soul. I continue looking for one. I found a woman with a wonderful soul but not a perfect body so I continued looking for. I found the perfect body with the perfect soul... but nothing happen because she was also looking for perfection..." This movie surface the risky angle of pursuing"the great love": you could not be her/his perfect love. My conclusion is: take the risk but buy an insurance and it is "love yourself, find the meaning of your life by yourself and if you find a loved one to go with you in this travel... ahhh that is happiness".
10	What is fascinating about this movie is that it really hits you hard. Certainly, it is just another indie mambo jumbo movie that actually found its way into the mainstream, but '(500) Days of Summer' really hits you hard with its realism and messages. With a great screen couple, JGL and Zooey Deschanel, the movie adds to the appeal that is already present with the realistic story and artsy details. It also teaches you a lot about life, about people and about relationships and I am certain that it will be a hot topic amongst your friends, as per the moral evaluation of Summer and... the guy JGL's playing (I keep forgetting his name - was it Tom?). I'm certain each of us had such an experience, both male and female, and it was, for me at leas, certainly lovely to see how things can turn out and I learned a lot as it really broadened my perspective and showed me clear signs of potential problems that I can now avoid. For all these reasons - a perfect 10!
8	500 Day of Summer is not like any other romantic comedy out there. You're not going to be able to predict how the film ends and it does not follow the classic stereotypes of rom coms. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel are excellent together and their movies on screen together are the best in the film. This film may be more applicable to young adults because the cast is relatively young. However the cast is strong with many recognisable faces for any movie fan.
10	Probably one of the most down to earth movies ever. This performance put Joseph Gordon-Levitt back on the map again. But do know, this is a drama, not a typical romantic comedy.
6	With great acting for the lead roles,great story and with a critical success,I expected a lot from this movie.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschannel are amazing in their role but, the story is not as original and clever as it pretends to be and the movie is really overrated.
